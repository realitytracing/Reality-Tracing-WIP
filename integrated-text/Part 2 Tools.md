## Part II — The Tools: Reality Tracing, Constraint Discipline, and Model Use

---

## Purpose of the Tools

This part describes the **tools that persist** across contexts.

They are not doctrines, conclusions, or policies. They are **disciplines of use**: ways of reasoning, tracking, and updating that remain functional under stress, disagreement, uncertainty, and partial failure.

These tools are not optimized for rhetorical victory, moral clarity, or theoretical elegance. They are optimized for:
- Staying in contact with reality  
- Reducing catastrophic error  
- Preserving livability and option space  
- Remaining usable under load  

They are meant to be **kept, refined, and revised**, not discarded when they become uncomfortable.

---

## Models, Compression, and Loss

A **model** is a simplified representation used to navigate reality.

All models are compressions:
- They reduce complexity  
- They discard information  
- They highlight some features and ignore others  

All compression is **lossy**. Lossiness explains limitation, not correctness. A model can be useful and wrong at the same time.

This framework treats models as:
- Provisional  
- Scoped  
- Disposable  

Models are tools, not assets. Attachment to a model beyond its scope is a primary source of epistemic overreach.

The governing question is not *“Is this model true?”* but:
> **“Under what constraints does this model reduce error and preserve viability?”**

---

## Reality Tracing

**Reality tracing** is the continuous practice of keeping models and beliefs in contact with real constraints and observed outcomes.

It is not passive description. It is active discipline.

Reality tracing includes:
- Monitoring pressure, strain, and failure  
- Updating or discarding models when they break  
- Treating breakdown as information rather than anomaly  

A primary diagnostic signal is **pressure**:
- Cognitive overload  
- Emotional escalation  
- Institutional brittleness  
- Rising enforcement cost  
- Permanent emergency framing  

Systems that remain compatible with ordinary, low-pressure life over sustained periods provide evidence of underlying fitness. Systems that persist only through escalating pressure, coercion, or continual emergency signaling indicate misalignment.

Reality tracing can be used without committing to replacement or reform.  
In many cases, the task is simply to treat an existing system as an artifact, trace where its costs land in human energy, attention, and time, and make those costs legible. Commitment, rejection, or redesign can occur later—if at all.

When outcomes diverge from expectation, the default assumption is **model incompleteness**, not exception.

**Model disposal is a feature, not a failure.**

## Constraint Tracking

Constraints are limits that shape what actions, outcomes, or trajectories are possible. They operate regardless of belief or intent.

Key constraints to track include:
- **Energy** (metabolic, cognitive, emotional, institutional)  
- **Capacity** (ability to absorb load without failure)  
- **Rate sensitivity** (how fast change can occur without breakdown)  
- **Irreversibility** (what cannot be undone within real limits)  
- **Path dependence** (how past actions constrain future options)  
- **Nonlinearity** (disproportionate effects from small causes)  

Constraint tracking shifts reasoning from moralized intent to **structural viability**.

Violating constraints does not produce error messages. It produces fatigue, fear, collapse, and harm.

---

## Property Tracking

Some variables are not visible at the physical layer but are nonetheless real, causal, and constraint-bound. This framework tracks them explicitly as **properties**, not metaphors.

Examples include:
- **Trust** — stored coordination energy that reduces cognitive and enforcement cost  
- **Legitimacy** — alignment between authority and acknowledged constraint  
- **Fear** — a high-gain signal often indicating rate violation or overload  
- **Attention** — a finite resource governing what can be processed or acted upon  
- **Meaning** — a stabilizing structure that sustains engagement and effort  

Tracking these properties allows systems to be analyzed without collapsing into:
- Psychologizing  
- Moralizing  
- Reductionism  

Loss of these properties is often an early warning of collapse.

## Layer Discipline and Category Error

Reality is **layered**. Different layers admit different valid descriptions and rules.

Typical layers include:
- Phenomenological (experience)  
- Psychological (behavior-shaping mechanisms)  
- Social (coordination among agents)  
- Institutional / economic (rule-mediated systems)  
- Model (abstractions and predictions)  
- Physical (hard constraints)  

A **category error** occurs when concepts valid in one layer are illegitimately applied to another.

Examples:
- Treating subjective distress as irrelevant because it is “not physical”  
- Treating moral intent as sufficient to override material limits  
- Treating statistical models as if they exhaust lived reality  

Layer discipline does not privilege one layer over others. It preserves **local validity without overreach**.

## Physics Discipline Without Physics Literalism

This framework borrows discipline from physics without importing equations or false precision.

What transfers upward:
- Finite energy, time, and attention  
- Causality  
- Path dependence  
- Irreversibility  
- Nonlinearity  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Phase transitions  
- Failure under load  

What does not transfer:
- Exact determinism  
- Microscopic completeness  
- Closed-form certainty  
- Observer independence  

Emergent systems require models that are:
- Discrete  
- Stable  
- Coherent  
- Useful  

Completeness is neither possible nor required.

## Stopping Rules, Boundaries, and Strategic Closure

Because reasoning capacity is finite, **stopping rules** are necessary.

Stopping rules operate **within reality tracing**.  
They exist to prevent epistemic overreach and false totalization.

Stopping rules define:
- When continued tracing no longer reveals new constraint-relevant structure  
- When analysis is looping without altering salience or energy flow  
- When further inference increases certainty without increasing contact with reality  

Stopping rules answer the question:
> **“Should this still be called reality tracing?”**

They enforce a **one-way boundary** between reality tracing and living.

Reality tracing is an analytic activity.  
Living is a condition that requires decision, commitment, and recovery.

Not all closures that occur while living belong inside reality tracing.

### Soft Closure (Inside Reality Tracing)

Within reality tracing, only **soft closures** are permitted:
- Tentative  
- Revisable  
- Scoped  
- Explicitly provisional  

Their function is to allow tracing to continue without paralysis.  
They do not claim final truth or end inquiry.

### Strategic / Structural Closure (Outside Reality Tracing)

**Strategic (or structural) closure** operates *outside* reality tracing.

It becomes necessary when:
- Constraints are known  
- Uncertainty is irreducible  
- Further tracing cannot resolve action  
- Coordination, recovery, or continuation is required  

Strategic closure does not claim epistemic finality.  
It selects an interpretation, precedent, or commitment so finite agents can move on.

Examples include:
- Legal verdicts and precedents  
- Treaties and deterrence doctrines  
- Emergency protocols  
- Institutional decisions  
- Strategic hope under irreversible risk  

Reality tracing may **inform** strategic closure, but it does not replace it.  
Confusing closure with tracing produces either ideological certainty or infinite regress. Both are failure modes.

Stopping rules protect epistemic discipline.  
Strategic closure protects livability.

## What These Tools Protect Against

Used together, these tools protect against:
- Treating abstraction as reality  
- Confusing intensity with truth  
- Converting uncertainty into authority  
- Moralizing constraint violations  
- Burning capacity to prove correctness  

They do not guarantee correct outcomes.  
They reduce the **cost of being wrong**.

---

## Classical Closure and Probabilistic Discipline

This framework makes deliberate use of two complementary modes of reasoning: **classical closure** and **probabilistic discipline**.

Classical closure stabilizes intuition into provisional objects, mechanisms, or models so inquiry and action can proceed.

Probabilistic discipline constrains those constructions by tracking uncertainty, distributions, pressure signals, and failure under load.

Classical closure enables action.  
Probabilistic discipline preserves realism.  

Reality tracing requires both.

Direction within this process emerges through **salience**: the ongoing flow of finite energy toward locally sustaining ends. Salience is not a tool itself, but the dynamic that gives tools direction.

---

## Status Reminder

These tools are:
- Revisable  
- Optional  
- Non-sacral  

They are retained because they survive contact with pressure, failure, and disagreement—not because they are pure, final, or universally compelling.

They exist to help reasoning remain **grounded, humane, and survivable** under constraint.

**Important:** Unless otherwise specified, claims in this framework are probabilistic.
