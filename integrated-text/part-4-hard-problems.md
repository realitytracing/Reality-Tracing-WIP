# Reality Tracing (WIP)  
## Part IV — Exceptionally Hard Problems, Collapse Logic, and Emergency Discipline

## Why Hard Problems Require a Separate Section

Some situations defeat ordinary moral reasoning, consensus-building, and gradual reform.

These are **hard problems**: contexts defined by scarcity, high stakes, irreversibility, time pressure, and already-maximized emotional and moral salience.

In hard problems:
- Not all values can be satisfied simultaneously  
- Not all harms can be prevented  
- Not all actors can be persuaded  
- Not all losses can be avoided  

This section exists because pretending otherwise produces **catastrophic error**.

---

## What Defines a Hard Problem

A situation qualifies as a hard problem when most or all of the following are true:
- Resources are insufficient to meet all needs  
- Time for deliberation is limited  
- Stakes involve irreversible harm  
- Cognitive and emotional capacity is already saturated  
- Disagreement is morally charged and identity-linked  

In such conditions, escalation does not produce clarity. It produces collapse.

---

## Non-Adjudication Under Stress

Even in hard problems, the **Non-Adjudicative Boundary** remains in force.

This framework does not judge:
- Total persons  
- Moral worth  
- Ultimate intentions  

Judgment under overload reliably:
- Corrodes trust  
- Accelerates fear dynamics  
- Increases identity fusion  
- Narrows option space  

Hard problems require **boundaries, protocols, and consequences**, not moral prosecution.

---

## Triage as Constraint Recognition

**Triage** is allocation under unavoidable scarcity.

It does not assign moral worth. It acknowledges a physical constraint: not all lives, needs, or values can be preserved simultaneously.

Without triage:
- Allocation defaults to chaos  
- Power fills the vacuum  
- More irreversible harm occurs  

The absence of triage is itself a decision—with predictable costs.

---

## Emergency Protocols

**Emergency protocols** are temporary, simplified rules for action under extreme constraint.

Their purposes are to:
- Prevent irreversible harm  
- Preserve core system function  
- Reduce cognitive load  
- Buy time for recovery or reassessment  

Effective emergency protocols are:
- Conservative  
- Low-dimensional  
- Explicitly temporary  
- Paired with stopping rules  

They are not substitutes for normal governance. Extending them indefinitely produces legitimacy collapse.

---

## Containment vs Resolution

In hard problems, **containment** often precedes resolution.

Containment means:
- Managing harm  
- Preventing escalation  
- Preserving coexistence  
- Maintaining minimal coordination  

Resolution—full agreement, justice, or reconciliation—may be impossible in the moment.

Attempting resolution prematurely often:
- Increases pressure  
- Hardens positions  
- Triggers detonation  

Containment is not surrender. It is **rate control under irreversibility**.

---

## Adversarial Environments and Bad-Faith Actors

Some environments are adversarial: actors actively exploit trust, ambiguity, or information channels.

**Bad-faith actors**:
- Knowingly manipulate narratives  
- Exploit fear and overload  
- Seek asymmetric advantage  

In such environments:
- Transparency is for observers, not attackers  
- Persuasion has diminishing returns  
- Over-explanation becomes a liability  

The appropriate shift is from persuasion to:
- Harm reduction  
- Channel preservation  
- Capacity protection  
- Documentation  

---

## Limits of Persuasion

Failure to persuade in hard problems usually reflects **capacity saturation**, not ignorance.

Signals that persuasion has failed include:
- Repetition without uptake  
- Escalating hostility  
- Moral compression  
- Demand for total allegiance  

At this point, continued argument increases damage.

The rational response is **mode shift**:
- Stop escalating explanation  
- Reduce salience  
- Preserve records  
- Maintain functioning systems  

Consensus is not the objective. **Survival and recoverability are.**

---

## Moral Sequencing

Moral reasoning is not abandoned in hard problems—it is **sequenced**.

During crisis:
- Apply emergency protocols  
- Minimize irreversible harm  
- Preserve system function  

After stabilization:
- Review outcomes  
- Debate criteria  
- Assign responsibility  
- Revise systems  

Delaying moral adjudication is not denial. It is realism under constraint.

---

## Exit, Refusal, and Capacity Protection

Allowing **exit without moral penalty** is essential in hard problems.

Exit includes:
- Disengagement  
- Refusal of participation  
- Rate reduction  
- Withdrawal to recover capacity  

Forcing participation under overload:
- Converts care into resentment  
- Accelerates burnout  
- Destroys empathy  

Exit is not betrayal. It is **capacity regulation**.

---

## Why These Rules Are Non-Negotiable

Hard problems are where frameworks are tested.

Naive systems fail here by:
- Demanding purity  
- Moralizing capacity limits  
- Treating escalation as virtue  
- Confusing intensity with commitment  

Constraint-aware systems survive by:
- Accepting loss  
- Localizing failure  
- Slowing rate  
- Preserving future option space  

These disciplines are not aspirational. They are **survival requirements**.

## Closing Reminder

Hard problems do not reward righteousness. They reward realism.

When stakes are high and options are narrow, the question is not:
> *“Who is right?”*

It is:
> **“What prevents irreversible harm and preserves the possibility of recovery?”**

This section exists to ensure that when reality offers no clean choices, the framework still functions—without lying, collapsing, or demanding the impossible.
