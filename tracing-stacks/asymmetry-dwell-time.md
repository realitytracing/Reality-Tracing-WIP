## Definition

**Asymmetry dwell time** is the duration an informational, coordination, or power asymmetry remains active before detection and correction.

Asymmetry itself is normal.

Persistence without detection is the risk variable.

## 1. Forms of Asymmetry

Asymmetry may involve:

- Information advantage
- Coordination advantage
- Speed advantage
- Resource concentration
- Narrative control
- Regulatory capture

These are structurally common.

No system is perfectly symmetric.

## 2. The Stability Condition

Let:

- D = Detection time
- A = Acceleration rate of the asymmetry’s effects
- C = Correction capacity

Stability tends to occur when:

D × A < C

Instability risk increases when:

D × A > C

This is not precise mathematics.
It is structural intuition.

If asymmetry grows faster than it is detected and corrected,
systemic instability increases.

## 3. Sources of Detection Delay

Dwell time increases when:

- Attention is synchronized elsewhere.
- Verification cost is high.
- Transparency is low.
- Institutions suppress dissent.
- Fatigue reduces vigilance.
- Incentives discourage whistleblowing.

Dwell time decreases when:

- Oversight is distributed.
- Salience is heterogeneous.
- Correction mechanisms are accessible.
- Information flows are open.
- Independent nodes exist.

---

## 4. Correlated Attention as Risk

When populations focus on the same narrative simultaneously:

- Blind spots widen.
- Overlooked domains expand.
- Asymmetry may grow undetected.

Total synchronization increases correlated vulnerability.

Resilient systems exhibit:

- Asynchronous awareness,
- Diverse salience allocation,
- Independent detection nodes.

Uniform vigilance is not required.

Distributed vigilance is sufficient.

---

## 5. Implications

- Asymmetry cannot be eliminated.
- Infinite asymmetry is unstable in reflexive systems.
- Detection latency determines outcome.
- Verification infrastructure shortens dwell time.
- Heterogeneous awareness reduces correlated failure.

The goal is not omniscience.

The goal is limiting asymmetry dwell time below collapse threshold.

---

## Final Form

Asymmetry is normal.

Persistent asymmetry is dangerous.

Detection reduces persistence.

Distributed awareness reduces detection delay.

Short dwell time preserves stability.

Long dwell time risks runaway.
