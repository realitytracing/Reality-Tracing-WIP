# Dynamics

This framework treats human cognition, behavior, and social systems as dynamic processes rather than static traits or identities.

Key dynamic properties include:
- Energy flow and depletion
- Rate sensitivity
- Feedback and threshold effects
- Emergence and decay
- Relative stability rather than permanence

Salience is visible only through movement. It cannot be frozen into a state or reduced to a single mechanism. It appears as the directional flow of energy toward locally sustaining ends, stabilizing through habituation and dissolving under overload or constraint violation.

Initialization of salient paths is contingent and chaotic, arising from the totality of passive and active biases present at a given moment. Stability emerges only later, and only relatively.

Overload occurs when the rate of energy demand exceeds processing capacity. Emotional overload, cognitive overload, and sensory overload are rate violations, not character flaws. The system enforces correction through fatigue, distress, or disengagement.

Loss of local ends produces disorientation and anger as salience searches for new viable trajectories. This liminal state is a transition, not a failure.

Dynamics govern collapse and recovery. Static explanations obscure how systems actually change under pressure.
