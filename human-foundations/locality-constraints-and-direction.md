title: Locality, Constraints, and Direction
---

## Status

This document clarifies the relationship between **locality** and **constraints** within the Reality Tracing framework.

It does not introduce new primitives.

It removes a common false separation.

This is a structural clarification, not a metaphysical claim.

## Locality as the Full State

Locality refers to the complete, current state of a system and its ongoing evolution.

This includes:

- Biological state  
- Cognitive state  
- Emotional state  
- Social context  
- Environmental conditions  
- Historical path dependence  
- Available resources  
- Current beliefs, models, and intentions  

It also includes differences in epistemic access:

- Known elements  
- Known unknowns  
- Unknown unknowns  

These distinctions describe the agent’s access within locality, not reality’s structure itself.

Locality is not a subset of reality.

It is everything that is happening *now*, as it continues to change — whether known, partially known, or unknown.

Nothing relevant to behavior, experience, or outcome exists outside locality.

## What Makes Constraints Distinct

Constraints are not external to locality.

They are not rules imposed from outside the system.  
They are not abstractions layered on top of reality.

Constraints are elements of locality that **never drop out**.

What distinguishes constraints is not that they are fixed, but that they are:

- Always present  
- Always binding  
- Always operative  
- Reflexive in application  

Constraints differ from other aspects of locality only in **persistence and structural role**, not in ontological status.

---

## Constraints as Reflexive Constants with Range

Constraints are best understood as **reflexive constants with bounded ranges**.

They are constant in that:

- They apply in every state  
- They cannot be suspended  
- They bind all processes, including reasoning about them  

They are variable in that:

- Their expressions vary by context  
- Their limits admit ranges rather than single values  
- Their effects depend on local configuration  

Examples include:

- Finite energy  
- Finite attention  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Irreversibility  
- Embodiment  
- Incomplete information  

These constraints are always present, but never identical in expression across situations.

## Reflexivity Prevents Self-Exemption

A defining feature of real constraints is **reflexivity**.

Constraints apply to:

- Action  
- Planning  
- Optimization  
- Modeling  
- Belief formation  
- Reality tracing itself  

A constraint that did not bind attempts to reason around it would not be a constraint at all.

Examples:

- Attention limits constrain theories about attention  
- Energy limits constrain plans to exceed energy  
- Rate limits constrain attempts to accelerate beyond viability  

Reflexivity prevents epistemic overreach and self-exempting models.

---

## No Separation Between Constraint and Locality

There is no clean boundary where locality ends and constraints begin.

Constraints are inside locality.  
They differ only in structural persistence.

A precise formulation:

> Locality is the full evolving state of a system.  
> Constraints are those elements of locality that are invariant in presence, variable in range, and reflexive in application.

This preserves:

- Unity of the system  
- Variability of experience  
- Persistence of limits

## Why This Matters for Salience

Salience operates within locality and under constraint.

Because constraints are always present:

- Salience never operates freely  
- Energy cannot flow arbitrarily  
- Direction must emerge without exemption  

Salience is not importance at initialization.

It becomes importance after energy repeatedly flows through paths that remain viable under constraint.

Without reflexive constraints:

- Salience would diffuse  
- Energy would fragment  
- Stable direction could not emerge  

Constraints provide the boundary conditions that make salience meaningful.

---

## Constants Are Not Rigid

Calling constraints “constants” does not imply rigidity.

They behave more like:

- Persistent axes  
- Invariants with tolerance  
- Lower-dimensional structures embedded in dynamic state space  

They shape trajectories without dictating exact outcomes.

This allows:

- Novelty  
- Exploration  
- Divergence  
- Context sensitivity  

While still preventing impossible states.

---

## Summary

- Locality includes everything that is happening, whether known or unknown  
- Constraints are not outside locality  
- Constraints are always present, but variable in expression  
- Reflexivity is what makes a constraint real  
- Salience emerges as direction within this structure  

Constraints do not stop movement.

They make direction possible.
