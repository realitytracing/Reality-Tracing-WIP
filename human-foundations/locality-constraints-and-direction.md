title: Locality, Constraints, and Direction

---
## Status

This document clarifies the relationship between **constraints** and **locality** within the Reality Tracing framework.

It does not introduce new primitives.
It removes a common false separation.

This is a structural clarification, not a metaphysical claim.

---

## Locality as the Full State

**Locality** refers to the complete, current state of a system and its evolution.

This includes:
- Biological state  
- Cognitive state  
- Emotional state  
- Social context  
- Environmental conditions  
- Historical path dependence  
- Available resources  
- Current beliefs, models, and intentions  

Locality is not a subset of reality.
It is **everything that is happening, now**, as it continues to change.

Nothing relevant to behavior, experience, or outcome exists outside locality.

---

## What Makes Constraints Different

Constraints are not external to locality.

They are not rules imposed from outside the system.
They are not abstractions layered on top of reality.

Constraints are **elements of locality that never drop out**.

What distinguishes constraints is not that they are fixed, but that they are:
- Always present  
- Always binding  
- Always operative  
- Reflexive in application  

Constraints differ from other aspects of locality only in **persistence**, not in ontological status.

## Constraints as Reflexive Constants with Range

Constraints are best understood as **reflexive constants with bounded ranges**.

They are constant in that:
- They apply in every state
- They cannot be suspended
- They bind all processes, including reasoning about them

They are variable in that:
- Their expressions vary by context
- Their limits admit ranges rather than single values
- Their effects depend on local configuration

Examples include:
- Finite energy  
- Finite attention  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Irreversibility  
- Embodiment  
- Incomplete information  

These constraints are always present, but never identical in expression across situations.

## Reflexivity Prevents Self-Exemption

A defining feature of real constraints is **reflexivity**.

Constraints apply to:
- Action  
- Planning  
- Optimization  
- Modeling  
- Belief formation  
- Reality tracing itself  

A constraint that did not bind attempts to reason around it would not be a constraint at all.

Examples:
- Attention limits constrain theories about attention  
- Energy limits constrain plans to exceed energy  
- Rate limits constrain attempts to optimize faster  

This reflexivity prevents epistemic overreach and self-exempting models.

---

## No Separation Between Constraint and Locality

There is no clean line where locality ends and constraints begin.

Constraints are **inside locality**, but they differ in role.

A precise formulation:

> **Locality is the full evolving state of a system.  
> Constraints are those elements of locality that are invariant in presence, variable in range, and reflexive in application.**

This preserves:
- Unity of the system  
- Variability of experience  
- Persistence of limits  

---

## Why This Matters for Salience

Salience operates **within locality** and **under constraints**.

Because constraints are always present:
- Salience never operates freely
- Energy cannot flow arbitrarily
- Direction must emerge without intent

Salience is therefore not importance at initialization.
It becomes importance **after** energy repeatedly flows through paths that remain viable under constraint.

Without reflexive constraints:
- Salience would diffuse
- Energy would fragment
- No stable direction could emerge

Constraints provide the boundary conditions that make salience meaningful.

---

## Constants Are Not Rigid

Calling constraints “constants” does not imply rigidity.

They behave more like:
- Persistent axes
- Invariants with tolerance
- Lower-dimensional structures embedded in dynamic state space

They shape trajectories without dictating exact outcomes.

This allows:
- Novelty  
- Exploration  
- Divergence  
- Context sensitivity  

While still preventing impossible states.

---

## Summary

- Locality includes **everything that is happening**
- Constraints are **not outside locality**
- Constraints are **always present**, but **never fixed in expression**
- Reflexivity is what makes a constraint real
- Salience emerges as direction **within** this structure

Constraints are not what stops movement.

They are what makes **direction possible**.
