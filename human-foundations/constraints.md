title: Constraints

Constraints are the non-negotiable limits that shape what can occur, persist, or fail across systems. They operate independently of belief, intent, morality, or narrative.

Constraints include, but are not limited to:
- Finite energy
- Time and rate limits
- Physical embodiment
- Cognitive bandwidth
- Information availability
- Irreversibility
- Path dependence

Constraints are not moral claims. They do not prescribe what *should* happen; they determine what *can* happen.

In human systems, constraints are lived continuously as fatigue, pressure, overload, scarcity, uncertainty, and failure. Confusion arises when abstracted models or narratives are mistaken for constraints themselves, producing artificial limits or false freedoms.

Constraint awareness does not eliminate choice or meaning. It bounds them. Reasoning that ignores constraint accumulates cost invisibly until failure forces recognition.

Reality tracing begins by locating where constraints are already being enforced.
