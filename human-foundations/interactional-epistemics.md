# Interactional Epistemics (WIP)

## A Permeability Criterion for Scientific and Philosophical Models

---

## Abstract

Scientific and philosophical models are often treated as closed systems whose internal consistency and empirical success are taken as indicators of ontological completeness. This paper argues that such closure is best understood as a practical abstraction rather than a feature of reality.

Because empirically studied systems exist within interacting environments, any model that claims to describe reality must remain open to interactions beyond its explicit scope.

I propose the **Interactional Permeability Principle**:

> A claim to reality based on a model is epistemically legitimate only if the agents administering that model admit its openness to interactions beyond its explicit scope, including known factors, known unknowns, and structurally unenumerated unknowns.

Persistent mismatches between model and observation—including unbounded extrapolation in bounded systems—are interpreted not as automatic evidence of hidden ontology, but as signals of boundary mismatch between abstraction and empirical constraint.

This framework is grounded in a combinatorial argument: modeling requires enumerating and partitioning empirical structure, and the space of possible partitions grows combinatorially. Multiple inequivalent models can therefore match the same finite dataset. Permeability becomes not merely philosophical humility but structural necessity.

Interactional Epistemics reframes scientific progress as adaptive compression under constraint rather than progressive closure toward final enumeration.

# 1. Introduction

Scientific models simplify reality for analysis. They isolate variables, bracket interactions, and operate under idealizations. These simplifications are indispensable; without them, prediction and coordination would be intractable.

An epistemic error occurs when practical simplifications are treated as ontological conclusions.

**Operational closure** — introduced for tractability — becomes mistaken for **isolation in reality**.

Consider Classical Mechanics. Newton’s equations are operationally closed; they do not account for relativistic effects. This does not make Newton’s work illegitimate. It was a masterwork of **Strategic Closure**. The epistemic error occurred only when later generations treated that strategic closure as **Structural Exhaustiveness**—assuming that because the model did not describe a speed limit for light, no such limit existed in nature.

The equations were innocent; the dogmatic interpretation was the failure.

This paper proposes a criterion designed to prevent such dogmatic closure while preserving the utility of bounded models.

# 2. The Problem of Ontological Closure

## 2.1 Strategic vs. Ontological Closure

**Strategic Closure**
- Boundaries explicitly declared.
- Scope limitations acknowledged.
- Simplifications recognized as operational.

**Ontological Closure**
- Boundaries treated as features of reality itself.
- Excluded variables treated as nonexistent.
- Model success mistaken for structural exhaustiveness.

Strategic closure is necessary for finite agents. Ontological closure requires demonstration of interactional exhaustiveness—a condition finite agents cannot guarantee.

---

## 2.2 The Artifact vs. The Attitude

Models are artifacts. They are static compressions of dynamic systems. An artifact cannot be dogmatic any more than a hammer can be violent.

- **Operational Closure** is a property of the artifact (e.g., an equation lacks a variable).
- **Epistemic Dogma** is a property of the attitude (e.g., insisting that what is not modeled does not exist).

Interactional Epistemics does not demand that models include everything. It demands that the attitude of the user remain permeable to what the model excludes.

The error is never the simplification. The error is denial of structure beyond the simplification.

---

## 2.3 Distinction from *Ceteris Paribus*

*Ceteris paribus* brackets background variables for tractable analysis.

Interactional Permeability regulates interpretation of bracketing:

- *Ceteris paribus* permits temporary isolation.
- Permeability forbids mistaking isolation for ontological completeness.

The first is methodological. The second is epistemic posture.

---

## 2.4 The Interactional Condition

Empirical systems exchange energy, matter, and information with environments. Any model of such systems is:

- A local compression.
- Embedded in broader interacting structure.

Operational closure is permissible. Ontological closure is not.

---

# 3. The Combinatorial Argument

## 3.1 Modeling Requires Enumeration

Modeling requires:
- Selecting variables
- Partitioning structure
- Defining objects
- Identifying invariances
- Discarding information

Each step is compression.

---

## 3.2 Enumeration Is Combinatorial

For sufficiently complex systems, the number of possible partitions grows combinatorially. Multiple inequivalent compressions can fit the same finite dataset.

Underdetermination is structural, not accidental. Finite agents cannot survey partition space exhaustively. Closure cannot be justified *a priori*.

---

## 3.3 The Apple Illustration

A single apple can be modeled as:
- One object
- Skin, flesh, core
- Cells
- Molecules
- Quantum fields

Or partitioned by:
- Magnetic alignment
- Functional role
- Observer-relative geometry

No unique object inventory is given directly by reality. Partitioning depends on invariance, purpose, and constraint. Objecthood is stabilized by interaction, not metaphysically pre-labeled.

---

## 3.4 Finite Agents and Overfitting

Finite agents:
- Select phenomena
- Choose salient variables
- Construct compression
- Ignore residual structure

A model may fit locally yet fail under expanded interaction.

Permeability functions as structural regularization against inevitable overfitting in combinatorial model space.

---

# 4. The Infinity and Constraint (Clamp) Heuristic

This section operationalizes Interactional Permeability.

The Infinity and Constraint Heuristic is not a metaphysical claim that “something hidden must exist.” It is a diagnostic discipline applied to bounded, energy-bearing systems.

Unbounded output is treated as a **boundary detection event**, not a metaphysical revelation.

---

## 4.1 Why Infinity Appears Easily in Models

Infinity often arises because abstraction removes enforcement.

In formal systems:
- Rules can be repeated.
- Transformations can be iterated.
- Recursion can proceed without cost.
- Termination is unspecified.

Formal infinity is a property of abstraction.

Empirical persistence is not.

---

## 4.2 Infinity as Boundary Mismatch Signal

When a model predicts:

- Infinite growth
- Infinite acceleration
- Infinite precision
- Infinite regress
- Infinite optimization
- Infinite oscillation without damping

within a materially bounded, time-bound, or energy-limited system, and no bounding mechanism is specified, this signals a **boundary mismatch between abstraction and empirical constraint**.

Infinity here is not automatically false.

It is a structural warning flag.

---

## 4.3 The Constraint Principle

Persistent systems require:

- Rate limits
- Resource ceilings
- Friction or dissipation
- Damping mechanisms
- Resolution limits
- Termination conditions
- Regime transitions

If a trajectory is modeled as unbounded while the system is finite-energy and time-bound, at least one of the following may hold:

1. The model exceeds its valid scale.
2. A constraint has been abstracted away.
3. The variable is mis-specified.
4. A regime transition has been ignored.
5. The extrapolation crosses into a domain governed by different invariances.
6. Conceptual lumping has merged distinct processes into one unified dynamic.

The heuristic does not demand invention of hidden forces.

It demands investigation of invariant structure and scale limits.

---

## 4.4 The Diagnostic Cascade

When infinity appears in a bounded system, evaluate in order:

1. **Computational instability** – Is the math unstable?
2. **Parameter mis-specification** – Are the inputs wrong?
3. **Algebraic or logical error** – Is the derivation flawed?
4. **Category mistake** – Are we measuring the wrong kind of thing?
5. **Proxy literalization** – Is a model artifact being treated as physical?
6. **Partition error** – Has the system been sliced incorrectly?
7. **Conceptual lumping** – Have distinct dynamics been conflated?
8. **Extrapolation beyond empirical range** – Are we outside validated scale?
9. **Regime transition omission** – Did the governing rules change?
10. **Omitted real-world constraint** – Is there an unmodeled clamp?

Only after earlier branches are reasonably excluded does inference to missing constraint gain strength.

Infinity is a boundary stress test.

---

## 4.5 Empirical Anchor Requirement

A proposed clamp must satisfy at least one:

- Direct observability
- Inference from measurable invariants
- Consistency with established rate or energy limits
- Falsifiability
- Experiential correlatability at human scale

If it cannot connect to observation in principle, it is speculative placeholder—not explanatory closure.

---

## 4.6 Mathematical vs Empirical Infinity

Mathematical infinities are legitimate within formal systems.

Empirical infinities require:
- Explicit asymptotic interpretation, or
- Declared idealization, or
- Known breakdown scale.

Failure to distinguish formal infinity from physical instantiation is category error.

---

## 4.7 Clamp as Permeability Detector

Interactional Permeability requires openness beyond scope.

Unbounded extrapolation without declared boundary is a hallmark of dogmatic closure.

Permeable models actively search for scale limits and regime shifts.

---

## 4.8 Proper Form of the Heuristic

The heuristic does not state:

> There must always be something hidden.

It states:

> When persistent bounded systems generate unbounded outputs without specified boundary mechanisms, investigate for boundary mismatch consistent with observable invariants.

---

# 5. The Interactional Permeability Principle

A claim to reality based on a model is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. **Administration:** Openness beyond explicit scope is admitted.
2. **Exclusion:** Exclusions are treated as unscoped influence, not non-existence.
3. **Updateability:** The model remains revisable under constraint expansion.
4. **Humility:** Hypothesis space is not treated as exhaustive.
5. **Signal Recognition:** Persistent mismatch—including unbounded output—is treated as structural signal.

---

# 6. Constraint, Convergence, and Robustness

Constraint filters model space.

Robust models:
- Survive scope expansion
- Integrate across domains
- Absorb anomaly
- Remain bounded under extrapolation

Scientific progress is adaptive stabilization under constraint.

---

# 7. Explanatory vs Engineering Modeling

**Explanatory Modeling**
- Expands scope
- Integrates domains
- Requires permeability

**Engineering Modeling**
- Restricts scope
- Enforces boundary conditions
- Uses safety margins acknowledging unknown interaction

Engineering closure is strategic. Explanatory closure is illegitimate.

---

# 8. Non-Teleological Realism

Interactional Epistemics rejects final enumeration. It affirms structured reality, constraint-driven stabilization, and scale-relative robustness.

## 8.1 Scale-Relative Validity

Newtonian mechanics is valid under constraint.

A model robust within declared scope is structurally valid—even if it fails outside scope.

- **Universalism:** This model is true everywhere.
- **Interactionalism:** This model is robust here. We check for clamps at the edges.

---

# 9. Relation to Existing Frameworks

- **Duhem–Quine:** Underdetermination is structural via combinatorial partition space.
- **Structural Realism:** Survivability under expanding interaction.
- **Lakatos:** Boundary defense becomes illegitimate when anomaly is dismissed.
- **Bayesianism:** Requires hypothesis-space humility.
- **Kuhn:** Closure illegitimate without demonstrated exhaustiveness.

---

# 10. Recursive Application

Interactional Epistemics is itself a model.

If it claims immunity to constraint, it violates its own principle.

Its legitimacy depends on remaining permeable.

---

# 11. Epistemic Culture and X-Axis Exploration

Permeability applies at:

1. Model level
2. Community level

Clamp signals at cultural scale include:
- Persistent anomaly accumulation
- Defensive rhetoric escalation
- Hypothesis-space freezing
- Suppression of cross-domain integration

Permeability requires interface openness, division of epistemic labor, and non-obstruction of cross-boundary inquiry.

---

# 12. Bidirectional Permeability Discipline

**Reception Discipline**
- Evaluate cross-domain attempts under constraint.
- Avoid reflexive boundary policing.

**Emission Discipline**
- Declare scope explicitly.
- Acknowledge asymmetry of expertise.
- Frame integrations as exploratory.
- Remain corrigible.

---

# 13. Conclusion

Empirical models are local compressions in combinatorial space. Finite agents cannot guarantee exhaustiveness. Persistent systems are bounded.

Scientific progress is adaptive stabilization under constraint.

Dogma arises when models deny interaction beyond scope, constraint beyond enumeration, or bounds beyond extrapolation.

Interactional Epistemics replaces final closure with disciplined openness under constraint.
