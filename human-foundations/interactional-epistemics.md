## A Permeability Criterion for Scientific and Philosophical Models

### Abstract
Scientific and philosophical models are often treated as closed systems whose internal consistency and empirical success are taken as indicators of truth. This paper argues that such closure is always a practical abstraction rather than an ontological fact. Because all modeled systems exist within an interacting reality, any model that claims to describe the world must remain open to interactions beyond its scope. I propose the **Interactional Permeability Principle**: a model is epistemically legitimate only if it admits that it is open to interactions from known factors, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. Persistent mismatches between model and observation are treated as constraints signaling unscoped structure. This framework shifts epistemology from the pursuit of closed truths to the mapping of open, interacting localities, and offers a criterion for distinguishing robust models from dogmatic ones.

## 1. Introduction
Scientific models necessarily simplify reality. They isolate variables, ignore interactions, and operate under idealized assumptions. Such simplifications are indispensable: without them, calculation and prediction would be impossible. However, a persistent epistemic error occurs when these practical simplifications are treated as ontological truths.

Historically, many models have been defended dogmatically despite clear anomalies. Economic models have ignored ecological constraints; classical mechanics ignored relativistic effects; early cosmology ignored discrepancies in galactic rotation curves. In each case, the model’s closure was treated not as a practical limit, but as a statement about reality.

This paper proposes a new epistemic criterion designed to prevent such dogmatic closure. The central claim is:

> Any model that claims to describe reality must admit that it is open to interactions beyond its scope.

This criterion is called the **Interactional Permeability Principle**.

## 2. The Problem of Ontological Closure

### 2.1 Traditional Criteria of Scientific Legitimacy
Scientific models are typically evaluated by:

1. Internal logical consistency  
2. Empirical adequacy  
3. Predictive success  

While necessary, these criteria are not sufficient. A model may satisfy all three while still:

- Ignoring interacting domains
- Treating idealizations as reality
- Defending itself against persistent mismatches

This produces **epistemic brittleness**: the model works within a narrow scope but fails outside it.

---

### 2.2 The Interactional Condition
No system in reality is perfectly isolated. All systems:

- Exchange energy
- Exchange matter
- Exchange information
- Exist within larger contexts

Therefore, any model describing a real system is necessarily:

- A **local approximation**
- Embedded in a larger interacting environment

This leads to a fundamental epistemic condition:

> Models may be operationally closed for calculation, but never ontologically closed in their claims.

---

### 2.3 Ceteris Paribus vs. Interactional Permeability
A likely objection to the Interactional Permeability Principle is that science already accounts for external influences through ceteris paribus clauses (“all other things being equal”). However, the two approaches differ in both epistemic posture and methodological consequence.
Ceteris paribus treats external factors as assumed constant or negligible for the purposes of analysis. Deviations are typically classified as noise, experimental error, or violations of background conditions. This framing is passively exclusionary: it brackets complexity to stabilize inference, but does not require ongoing attention to what has been excluded.
Interactional permeability, by contrast, treats excluded factors as actively real and potentially consequential over time. Rather than assuming stability outside the model, it assumes eventual interaction. Persistent deviations are not treated as noise to be averaged out, but as signals of unscoped structure pressing on the model boundary.
In this sense, ceteris paribus stabilizes models by holding the world still. Interactional permeability stabilizes inquiry by expecting the world to move.
This distinction matters because many historical failures of models occurred not because ceteris paribus was false in principle, but because its temporary bracketing was mistaken for ontological isolation.
That paragraph alone makes the paper much harder to wave away.

## 3. The Interactional Permeability Principle

### Core Criterion
A model is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. It admits that it is open to interactions beyond its scope.
2. It treats excluded factors as unscoped influences rather than nonexistent ones.
3. It interprets persistent mismatches as constraints indicating unscoped structure.

## 3.1 Permeability as an Epistemic Stance, Not an Ontological Law

The Interactional Permeability Principle is not presented here as a law of nature, a metaphysical axiom, or a universal obligation imposed on all theorists.
It is a declared epistemic stance adopted by a person or group when they claim a model describes reality.
To adopt this stance is to commit to holding one’s models as:
operationally useful but ontologically incomplete
open to interaction beyond their scoped variables
revisable under persistent constraint pressure
This principle therefore functions as a self-binding discipline, not an external rule. Other agents or traditions may choose ontological closure, but such closure is then understood as a deliberate modeling posture rather than a property of reality itself.
Within this stance, dogmatism is not defined by holding a model strongly, but by denying the reality of what lies beyond the model’s scope when faced with persistent mismatch.
The Interactional Permeability Principle thus specifies how a model is held, not what reality must be.

## 4. The Principles of Interactional Epistemics

### 4.1 Law of Interactional Embeddedness
No model exists outside reality. Every modeled system is subject to interactions beyond the model’s scope.

Perfect isolation is always:

- A calculational abstraction
- Never an ontological fact

Thus, every model is a **local description** within a larger interacting structure.

---

### 4.2 Principle of Permeable Claims
A model may be closed for operational purposes but must remain open in its ontological claims.

| Type of Closure | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| Operational closure (for tractability) | Legitimate |
| Ontological closure (claiming isolation is real) | Illegitimate |

A model becomes dogmatic when:

- Its practical limits are treated as statements about reality.

---

### 4.3 The Minimal Admission Rule
A model does not need to enumerate all excluded interactions.  
It must only admit that its scope is limited and that external influences exist.

Every model must admit openness to:

1. **Known factors** outside its scope.
2. **Known unknowns**—suspected but poorly understood influences.
3. **Unknown unknowns**—interactions not yet conceived.

These are treated as:

> Unscoped interactions: real influences beyond the model’s current boundary.

---

### 4.4 The Constraint Principle
Scientific progress is often driven by persistent mismatches between models and observations.

#### Definition: Constraint
A constraint is:

> A stable, repeatable limitation on a model’s predictions or structure that indicates an unscoped interaction, variable, or organizing principle.

The constraint may be:

- A hidden variable
- A new law
- A structural relation
- A theoretical entity

What matters is:

- The persistent pressure it places on the model.

---

### 4.5 The Clash Principle
When two models or domains conflict, neither may claim ontological authority.

Instead:

- The conflict is treated as a signal of an unscoped interaction.
- The boundary between models must be inspected.

Thus:

> A model may not defend itself by claiming to be reality when confronted with an external clash.

Conflicts become:

- Sites of investigation
- Not grounds for dogmatic defense

---

## 5. From Certainty to Robustness

Traditional epistemology aims at:

- Universal truths
- Precise predictions
- Closed systems

Interactional Epistemics shifts the goal to:

- Boundary awareness
- Predictive robustness
- Open interacting models

| Traditional Goal | Interactional Goal |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Exact truth | Local reliability |
| Closed systems | Open localities |
| Certainty | Robustness under interaction |
| Hidden assumptions | Admitted scope limits |
| Noise elimination | Boundary awareness |

## 6. Relation to Existing Philosophies of Science

### 6.1 Popper: Falsifiability
Popper emphasized falsifiability as the demarcation criterion of science.

Interactional Epistemics extends this by asking:

- Not only whether a model can be falsified
- But whether it admits where falsification may come from

Permeability becomes a structural precondition for falsifiability.

---

### 6.2 Kuhn: Paradigms and Anomalies
Kuhn emphasized the role of anomalies in paradigm shifts.

Interactional Epistemics reframes anomalies as:

- Persistent constraints
- Signals of unscoped interaction

---

### 6.3 Lakatos: Research Programs
Lakatos described scientific theories as research programs with a hard core and a protective belt.

Interactional Epistemics reframes this structure as:

- A local model
- Embedded in a field of interacting constraints

---

## 7. Conclusion
Scientific models are not islands. They are local structures embedded within an interacting reality. Treating their boundaries as ontological truths leads to dogmatism, brittleness, and epistemic failure.

The Interactional Permeability Principle offers a new criterion:

> A model is legitimate not when it is perfectly closed, but when it admits that it is open to interactions beyond its scope.

Scientific progress then becomes the process of:

- Discovering constraints
- Mapping boundaries
- Integrating interacting domains

---

## Final Thesis
**A model becomes dogmatic the moment it denies the reality of what lies outside its scope.**
