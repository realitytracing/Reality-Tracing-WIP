# Interactional Epistemics

## A Permeability Criterion for Scientific and Philosophical Models

---

# Abstract

Scientific and philosophical models are often treated as closed systems whose internal consistency and empirical success are taken as indicators of truth. This paper argues that such closure is best understood as a practical abstraction rather than an ontological fact.

Because empirically studied systems exist within interacting environments, any claim to reality grounded in a model must remain open to interactions beyond its explicit scope.

I propose the **Interactional Permeability Principle**:

> A claim to empirical reality based on a model is epistemically legitimate only if the agents administering that model admit its openness to interactions beyond its explicit scope, including known factors, known unknowns, and structurally unenumerated unknowns.

Persistent mismatches between model and observation are interpreted as constraints signaling unscoped structure rather than mere noise.

This framework is grounded in a combinatorial argument: modeling requires enumerating and partitioning empirical structure, and the space of possible partitions grows combinatorially. Multiple inequivalent models can therefore match the same finite dataset. Permeability is not philosophical politeness; it is structural necessity.

Interactional Epistemics reframes scientific progress as adaptive compression under constraint rather than progressive closure toward final enumeration.

# 1. Introduction

Scientific models simplify reality for analysis. They isolate variables, bracket interactions, and operate under idealizations. These simplifications are indispensable; without them, prediction and coordination would be intractable.

The epistemic error is not simplification.

The epistemic error occurs when practical simplifications are treated as ontological conclusions.

Operational closure — introduced for tractability — becomes mistaken for isolation in reality.

Historically, models have been defended beyond their domains:

- Economic models bracketing ecological constraints  
- Classical mechanics extended beyond relativistic domain  
- Cosmological models prior to galactic rotation anomalies  

In each case, pragmatic boundaries were implicitly treated as structural exhaustiveness.

Interactional Epistemics introduces a criterion designed to prevent this transition from strategic closure to ontological dogma.

---

# 2. The Problem of Ontological Closure

## 2.1 Strategic vs Ontological Closure

**Strategic Closure**
- Boundaries explicitly declared  
- Scope limitations acknowledged  
- Simplifications recognized as operational  

**Ontological Closure**
- Boundaries treated as features of reality itself  
- Excluded variables treated as nonexistent  
- Model success mistaken for structural exhaustiveness  

Strategic closure is necessary for finite agents.

Ontological closure requires demonstration of interactional exhaustiveness — a condition finite agents cannot guarantee.

---

## 2.2 The Artifact vs The Attitude

Models are artifacts.

They are compressions of interacting systems.

An artifact cannot be dogmatic.

Dogma is a property of attitude.

- **Operational Closure** is a property of the artifact.
- **Epistemic Dogma** is a property of the administering agent.

Newton’s equations do not contain relativistic corrections.  
That is operational closure.

The error would be insisting that because the equations lack time dilation, time dilation cannot exist.  
That is epistemic dogma.

Interactional Epistemics does not demand that models include everything.

It demands that agents acknowledge what models exclude.

The simplification is not the failure.

The denial of excluded structure is the failure.

---

## 2.3 Distinction from *Ceteris Paribus*

*Ceteris paribus* is a bracketing tool.

It freezes background variables for tractable analysis.

Interactional Permeability does not forbid bracketing.

It regulates how bracketing is interpreted.

- *Ceteris paribus* permits isolation.
- Permeability forbids mistaking isolation for ontological completeness.

The first is methodological.
The second is epistemic posture.

---

## 2.4 The Interactional Condition

Empirical systems exchange energy, matter, and information across domains.

Any model of such systems is:

- A local compression  
- Embedded in broader interacting structure  

Operational closure is permissible.

Ontological closure is not.

---

# 3. The Combinatorial Argument

## 3.1 Modeling Requires Enumeration

Modeling requires:

- Selecting variables  
- Partitioning structure  
- Defining objects  
- Identifying invariances  
- Discarding information  

Each step is compression.

---

## 3.2 Enumeration Is Combinatorial

For sufficiently complex systems, the number of possible partitions grows combinatorially.

Multiple inequivalent compressions can fit the same finite dataset.

Underdetermination is therefore structural, not accidental.

Finite agents cannot survey partition space exhaustively.

Closure cannot be justified a priori.

---

## 3.3 The Apple Illustration

Consider a single apple.

It may be modeled as:

- One object  
- Skin, flesh, core  
- Cells  
- Molecules  
- Quantum fields  

Or partitioned by:

- Magnetic alignment  
- Functional role  
- Observer-relative geometry  

No unique object inventory is given directly by reality.

Objecthood is stabilized by invariance under interaction — not metaphysically pre-labeled.

---

## 3.4 Finite Agents and Overfitting

Finite agents:

1. Select phenomena  
2. Choose salient variables  
3. Construct compression  
4. Ignore residual structure  

A model may fit locally yet fail under expanded interaction.

Permeability functions as structural regularization against inevitable overfitting in combinatorial model space.

# 4. The Infinity and Clamp Heuristic

This section operationalizes permeability.

## 4.1 Infinity as Diagnostic Signal

When an empirical model predicts:

- Infinite growth  
- Infinite acceleration  
- Infinite precision  
- Infinite regress  
- Infinite optimization  
- Infinite oscillation without damping  

without specifying a bounding mechanism,

it signals unscoped constraint.

Persistent, finite-energy systems do not sustain empirical infinities.

Infinity is not automatically false.

It is a diagnostic warning.

---

## 4.2 The Clamp Principle

All persistent systems are bounded.

Persistence requires:

- Rate limits  
- Resource ceilings  
- Friction  
- Damping  
- Resolution limits  
- Termination rules  

If a trajectory is modeled as unbounded within a finite-energy, time-bound system, then one of the following holds:

1. The model exceeds its valid scale  
2. A constraint has been abstracted away  
3. The variable is mis-specified  
4. A regime transition has been ignored  

Unbounded empirical prediction without explicit boundary mechanism is diagnostic of missing constraint.

---

## 4.3 Clamp as Permeability Detector

Clamp detection identifies where interaction is missing.

Unbounded extrapolation without boundary specification is a hallmark of dogmatic administration.

Permeable modeling actively searches for clamps.

---

# 5. The Interactional Permeability Principle

A claim to empirical reality grounded in a model is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. Openness beyond scope is acknowledged  
2. Exclusions are treated as unscoped influences  
3. Hypothesis space remains expandable  
4. Persistent anomaly is treated as structural signal  
5. Unbounded prediction is treated as clamp candidate  

Permeability governs posture, not algebra.

---

# 6. Constraint, Convergence, and Scale-Relative Validity

Constraint filters model space.

Robust models:

- Survive scope expansion  
- Integrate across domains  
- Absorb anomaly  
- Remain bounded under extrapolation  

A model may be structurally incomplete yet valid at a given scale.

Newtonian mechanics is not hallucination.

It is scale-relative compression.

Interactional Epistemics rejects universalism, not local validity.

---

# 7. Explanatory vs Engineering Modeling

**Explanatory Modeling**
- Expands scope  
- Integrates domains  
- Requires permeability  

**Engineering Modeling**
- Restricts scope  
- Enforces boundary conditions  
- Uses safety margins  

Engineering closure is strategic.

Explanatory closure becomes illegitimate only when administered dogmatically.

---

# 8. Non-Teleological Realism

Interactional Epistemics rejects:

- Final enumeration  
- Guaranteed universal carving  
- Teleological inevitability  

It affirms:

- Structured reality  
- Constraint-driven stabilization  
- Domain-relative robustness  

Structure persists as invariance across expanding interaction — not as fixed object inventory.

---

# 9. Epistemic Culture and X-Axis Exploration

Permeability is both a modeling principle and a governance principle.

A community may possess formally permeable models yet behave dogmatically.

Permeability must exist at two levels:

## 9.1 Model-Level Permeability
- Declared scope  
- Openness to anomaly  
- Expandable hypothesis space  

## 9.2 Community-Level Permeability
- Tolerance for boundary testing  
- Incentive support for anomaly research  
- Encouragement of cross-domain comparison  

---

## 9.3 X-Axis Exploration

Scientific progress occurs along two axes:

- **Y-axis**: Depth within a domain  
- **X-axis**: Cross-domain integration  

Clamp detection often emerges between domains.

Economic models encounter ecological limits.  
AI optimization encounters alignment constraints.  
Cosmology encounters quantum boundaries.

The clamp often appears at the intersection.

X-axis exploration is structural regularization at civilizational scale.

---

## 9.4 Cross-Integration as Structural Resilience

Uniform grain fractures.

Heterogeneous fibers bend.

Epistemic systems resemble wood.

Pure specialization increases precision.
Cross-integration increases resilience.

Robust knowledge systems require both.

---

## 9.5 Bidirectional Permeability Discipline

Cross-domain interaction requires two disciplines:

### Reception Discipline
- Do not dismiss exploratory integration reflexively  
- Evaluate under constraint, not status  
- Treat anomaly as potential signal  

### Emission Discipline
- Declare scope explicitly  
- Acknowledge expertise asymmetry  
- Frame claims as exploratory  
- Remain updateable  

Permeability is reciprocal.

Without reception discipline, exploration dies.
Without emission discipline, speculation metastasizes.

---

# 10. Recursive Application

Interactional Epistemics is itself a model.

If it claims:

- Infinite explanatory reach  
- Exhaustive mapping  
- Immunity to constraint  

it violates its own clamp principle.

Its legitimacy derives from remaining permeable.

---

# 11. Conclusion

Empirical models are local compressions in combinatorial space.

Finite agents cannot guarantee exhaustiveness.

Persistent systems are bounded.

Infinity without clamp signals unscoped structure.

Models are artifacts.

Dogma is an attitude.

Scientific progress is adaptive stabilization under constraint and cross-domain interaction.

Interactional Epistemics replaces final closure with disciplined openness under constraint.
