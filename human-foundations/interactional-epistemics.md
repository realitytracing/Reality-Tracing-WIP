## A Permeability Criterion for Scientific and Philosophical Models

---

## Abstract

Scientific and philosophical models are often treated as closed systems whose internal consistency and empirical success are taken as indicators of truth. This paper argues that such closure is best understood as a practical abstraction rather than an ontological fact. Because empirically studied systems exist within interacting environments, any model that claims to describe reality must remain open to interactions beyond its explicit scope.

I propose the **Interactional Permeability Principle**: a model that aims to describe empirical reality is epistemically legitimate only if it admits its openness to interactions from known factors, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. Persistent mismatches between model and observation are interpreted as constraints signaling unscoped structure rather than mere noise.

This framework is grounded in a combinatorial argument: modeling requires enumerating and partitioning empirical structure, and the space of possible partitions grows explosively. Multiple inequivalent models can therefore match the same finite dataset. Permeability becomes not merely a philosophical recommendation but a structural necessity.

Interactional Epistemics shifts epistemology from the pursuit of closed, final truths to the mapping of open, interacting localities. It offers a criterion for distinguishing strategically bounded models from dogmatically closed ones and reframes scientific progress as adaptive compression under constraint.

## 1. Introduction

Scientific models simplify aspects of reality for analysis. They isolate variables, ignore interactions, and operate under idealized assumptions. Such simplifications are indispensable: without them, calculation and prediction would be intractable.

A recurring epistemic error occurs when practical simplifications are treated as ontological conclusions. Operational closure—introduced for tractability—becomes mistaken for isolation in reality.

Historically, models have been defended despite accumulating anomalies:

- Economic models that bracket ecological constraints  
- Classical mechanics applied beyond its relativistic domain  
- Early cosmological models prior to resolving galactic rotation discrepancies  

In each case, practical limits were implicitly treated as statements about the structure of reality itself.

This paper proposes a criterion designed to prevent such dogmatic closure:

> Any model that claims to describe empirical reality must admit that it is open to interactions beyond its scope.

This is the **Interactional Permeability Principle**.

## 2. The Problem of Ontological Closure

### 2.1 Traditional Criteria of Scientific Legitimacy

Scientific models are typically evaluated by:

- Internal logical consistency  
- Empirical adequacy  
- Predictive success  

These criteria are necessary but not sufficient. A model may satisfy all three while still:

- Ignoring interacting domains  
- Treating idealizations as literal structure  
- Deflecting persistent mismatches as noise  

This produces **epistemic brittleness**.

---

### 2.2 Strategic vs Ontological Closure

**Strategic Closure**
- Boundaries explicitly declared  
- Scope limitations acknowledged  
- Simplifications recognized as operational  

**Ontological Closure**
- Boundaries treated as real features of reality  
- Excluded variables treated as nonexistent  
- Model success mistaken for structural exhaustiveness  

Strategic closure is necessary.  
Ontological closure is unjustified unless interactional exhaustiveness is demonstrated.

---

### 2.3 Distinction from *Ceteris Paribus*

*Ceteris paribus* is a local bracketing operator. It temporarily freezes background variables for tractable analysis.

Interactional Permeability does not regulate bracketing itself.  
It regulates how bracketing is interpreted epistemically.

- *Ceteris paribus* allows isolation.
- Interactional Permeability forbids treating that isolation as ontological completeness.

The former is methodological convenience.  
The latter is epistemic discipline.

---

### 2.4 The Interactional Condition

Empirically studied systems are embedded in interacting environments.

Accordingly, any model is:

- A local approximation  
- Embedded in broader structure  

Operational closure is permissible.  
Ontological closure is not.

## 3. The Combinatorial Argument for Permeability

### 3.1 Modeling Requires Enumeration

Modeling requires:

- Selecting variables  
- Partitioning data  
- Defining objects  
- Discarding information  

Each step is an act of compression.

---

### 3.2 Enumeration Is Combinatorial

The number of possible partitions of empirical structure grows combinatorially.

Multiple inequivalent models can fit the same finite dataset.

Underdetermination is structural, not accidental.

---

### 3.3 Finite Agents and Overfitting

Finite agents cannot enumerate all partitions.

A model may fit locally yet fail under expanded interaction.

Permeability functions as structural regularization against inevitable overfitting.

---

### 3.4 Permeability and Bayesian Updating

Bayesian updating redistributes credibility within a hypothesis space.

However, combinatorial abundance implies:

No finite hypothesis space can be guaranteed exhaustive.

Dogmatic closure occurs when:

- Posterior concentration is treated as ontological certainty, or  
- Hypothesis space is prematurely fixed.

True permeability requires openness to model-class expansion.

---

## 4. The Infinity and Clamp Heuristic

### 4.1 Infinity as Diagnostic Signal

When a model predicts:

- Infinite growth  
- Infinite acceleration  
- Infinite precision  
- Infinite regress  
- Infinite optimization  
- Infinite oscillation without damping  

without specifying a bounding mechanism,

it signals unscoped structure.

Persistent empirical systems do not sustain physical infinities.

Infinity is not automatically false.
It is a structural warning flag.

---

### 4.2 The Clamp Principle

Observable, energy-bearing systems persist only if bounded.

Persistence requires:

- Rate limits  
- Resource constraints  
- Friction  
- Damping  
- Termination rules  
- Finite resolution  

If a trajectory is modeled as unbounded while the system is finite-energy and time-bound, then:

1. The model exceeds its valid scale, or  
2. A constraint has been abstracted away, or  
3. The variable is mis-specified across scale.

Infinity indicates missing clamp.

---

### 4.3 Cross-Domain Application

Physical:
- Infinite energy density signals regime breakdown.

Biological:
- Infinite metabolic demand results in death.

Psychological:
- Infinite rumination collapses into overload.

Institutional:
- Infinite growth produces collapse.

In each case, reality enforces bounds.

---

### 4.4 Relation to Permeability

The Clamp Heuristic operationalizes permeability.

Where permeability states:
> Models must remain open to unscoped interaction,

the clamp principle detects where interaction is missing.

Unbounded predictions signal unmodeled constraint.

Dogmatic closure often appears as:

- Infinite extrapolation without boundary
- Treating asymptotes as literal futures
- Denying regime transitions

Permeable models search for clamps.

---

## 5. The Interactional Permeability Principle

A model describing empirical reality is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. It admits openness beyond its scope.
2. It treats exclusions as unscoped influences.
3. It remains updateable under expanding constraint.
4. It interprets persistent mismatch as structural signal.

Infinity without clamp is one form of mismatch.

---

## 6. Constraint, Convergence, and Robustness

Constraint filters model space.

Robust models:

- Survive scope expansion  
- Integrate across domains  
- Absorb anomaly  

Science progresses through survivability under interaction.

---

## 7. Explanatory vs Engineering Modeling

**Explanatory modeling**
- Expands scope  
- Integrates domains  
- Requires permeability  

**Engineering modeling**
- Restricts scope  
- Enforces boundaries  
- Uses safety margins acknowledging unknown interaction  

---

## 8. Non-Teleological Realism

Interactional Epistemics rejects:

- Final enumeration  
- Guaranteed convergence to a single carving  

It affirms:

- Structured reality  
- Constraint-driven stabilization  
- Domain-relative robustness  

---

## 9. Recursive Application

Interactional Epistemics is itself a model.

It must remain permeable.

If it predicts infinite explanatory reach without constraint,
it violates its own clamp principle.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Empirical models are local compressions in combinatorial space.

Finite agents cannot guarantee exhaustiveness.

Persistent systems are bounded.

Infinity without clamp signals unscoped structure.

Scientific progress is adaptive stabilization under constraint.

A model becomes dogmatic when it denies:

- Structure beyond scope  
- Constraint beyond enumeration  
- Bounds beyond extrapolation  

Interactional Epistemics replaces final closure with disciplined openness under constraint.
