## A Permeability Criterion for Scientific and Philosophical Models

---

## Abstract

Scientific and philosophical models are often treated as closed systems whose internal consistency and empirical success are taken as indicators of truth. This paper argues that such closure is best understood as a practical abstraction rather than an ontological fact. Because empirically studied systems exist within interacting environments, any model that claims to describe reality must remain open to interactions beyond its explicit scope.

I propose the **Interactional Permeability Principle**: a model that aims to describe empirical reality is epistemically legitimate only if it admits its openness to interactions from known factors, known unknowns, and unknown unknowns. Persistent mismatches between model and observation are interpreted as constraints signaling unscoped structure rather than mere noise.

This framework is grounded in a combinatorial argument: modeling requires enumerating and partitioning empirical structure, and the space of possible partitions grows explosively. Multiple inequivalent models can therefore match the same finite dataset. Permeability becomes not merely a philosophical recommendation but a structural necessity.

Interactional Epistemics shifts epistemology from the pursuit of closed, final truths to the mapping of open, interacting localities. It offers a criterion for distinguishing strategically bounded models from dogmatically closed ones, and reframes scientific progress as adaptive compression under constraint.

## 1. Introduction

Scientific models simplify aspects of reality for the purposes of analysis. They isolate variables, ignore interactions, and operate under idealized assumptions. Such simplifications are indispensable: without them, calculation and prediction would be intractable.

A recurring epistemic error occurs when these practical simplifications are treated as ontological conclusions. Operational closure—introduced for tractability—becomes mistaken for isolation in reality.

Historically, models have often been defended despite accumulating anomalies:

- Economic models that bracket ecological constraints  
- Classical mechanics applied beyond its relativistic domain  
- Early cosmological models prior to resolving galactic rotation discrepancies  

In each case, practical limits were implicitly treated as statements about the structure of reality itself.

This paper proposes a criterion designed to prevent such dogmatic closure:

> Any model that claims to describe empirical reality must admit that it is open to interactions beyond its scope.

This is the **Interactional Permeability Principle**.

## 2. The Problem of Ontological Closure

### 2.1 Traditional Criteria of Scientific Legitimacy

Scientific models are typically evaluated by:

- Internal logical consistency  
- Empirical adequacy  
- Predictive success  

These criteria are necessary but not sufficient. A model may satisfy all three while still:

- Ignoring interacting domains  
- Treating idealizations as literal structure  
- Deflecting persistent mismatches as noise  

This produces **epistemic brittleness**: the model performs well within a narrow scope but fails under expanded interaction.

---

### 2.2 The Interactional Condition

Empirically studied systems are not perfectly isolated. They exist within environments in which they exchange energy, matter, or information, and are embedded within broader causal structures.

Accordingly, any model describing such a system is:

- A local approximation  
- Embedded within a larger interacting context  

Models may be operationally closed for calculation, but should not be treated as ontologically closed in their claims about reality.

This is not a metaphysical claim about the universe. It is a methodological constraint governing how empirical models should be held.

---

## 3. The Combinatorial Argument for Permeability

The need for permeability follows from structural features of modeling itself.

### 3.1 Modeling Requires Enumeration

Empirical data is not given as pre-packaged “objects.” It consists of continuous, interacting, high-dimensional processes. To construct a model, we must:

- Select variables  
- Partition data  
- Define objects  
- Establish relations  
- Identify invariances  
- Discard information  

Each of these steps is an act of **enumeration and partitioning**.

The world does not arrive with boundaries labeled. Objecthood is stabilized through interaction and compression.

---

### 3.2 Enumeration Is Combinatorial

For any sufficiently complex dataset, the number of possible ways to:

- Partition it  
- Group it into objects  
- Assign relations  
- Select invariances  

grows combinatorially.

Multiple structurally distinct models can therefore fit the same finite dataset.

This is not skepticism. It is structural abundance.

---

### 3.3 The Apple Thought Experiment

Consider a simple apple.

How many objects are in it?

- One apple  
- Skin, flesh, core, seeds  
- Millions of cells  
- Trillions of molecules  
- Quantum excitations  

Or we may group non-neighboring regions by:

- Magnetic polarity  
- Orientation  
- Phase  
- Functional role  
- Observer-relative geometry  

There is no uniquely privileged object count given directly by reality. Instead:

- Reality supplies structured interaction.  
- Partitioning depends on invariance and purpose.  
- Constraints stabilize some partitions and destabilize others.  

Objecthood is not arbitrary. But neither is it uniquely fixed.

---

### 3.4 Angle-Space and Structural Abundance

Any phenomenon can be approached from many legitimate structural angles:

- Thermodynamic  
- Mechanical  
- Biochemical  
- Gravitational  
- Economic  
- Relational  

Reality supports overlapping invariances. Different modeling aims stabilize different compressions.

We cannot survey all possible partitions. Finite agents explore angle-space selectively.

This structural richness ensures that closure cannot be justified in advance.

---

### 3.5 Finite Agents and Overfitting

Finite agents cannot enumerate all possible partitions of empirical data.

When modeling:

1. A target phenomenon is selected.  
2. Salient variables are chosen.  
3. A compression is constructed.  
4. Non-salient structure is ignored.  

This is necessary. But it creates structural risk.

Like statistical overfitting, a model may perform perfectly within a limited domain while failing under expanded interaction.

Permeability is therefore not humility for its own sake. It is regularization against inevitable overfitting in combinatorial model space.

---

## 4. The Interactional Permeability Principle

### Core Criterion

A model that claims to describe empirical reality is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. It admits openness to interactions beyond its explicit scope.  
2. It treats excluded factors as unscoped influences rather than nonexistent ones.  
3. It interprets persistent mismatches as constraints indicating unscoped structure.  

Permeability is required because agents cannot determine whether their variable space exhausts interactional structure.

### 4.1 Strategic vs. Dogmatic Closure

#### Strategic Closure

- Boundaries acknowledged  
- Scope explicitly declared  
- Constraint pressure expected  

#### Dogmatic Closure

- Boundaries denied  
- Anomalies minimized as noise  
- Coherence mistaken for completeness  

The difference concerns epistemic posture, not model sophistication.

---

## 5. Constraint, Convergence, and Robustness

### 5.1 Constraint as Structural Detection

Mismatch is not mere error.  
It is signal.

Constraints reveal interaction beyond scope.

An anomaly is structural information.

---

### 5.2 Convergence Under Constraint

Some aspects of modeling are relative to aim and scale. But constraint causes convergence.

Different models may begin from different compressions. Under cross-domain testing, they converge.

Relativity is filtered by interaction.

---

### 5.3 Robustness as Survivability Under Expansion

Robustness is:

- Stability under new interaction  
- Integration across domains  
- Constraint absorption  
- Survival under scope expansion  

Science progresses not by discovering a final enumeration, but by constructing compressions that survive broader exposure.

---

## 6. A Geometric Representation of Understanding

Understanding can be represented heuristically in a two-dimensional plane:

- **X-axis:** Degree of model-to-model integration  
- **Y-axis:** Scope of the object or domain being explained  

Low X, Low Y:  
Isolated, narrow models.

High X, High Y:  
Broad scope, deeply integrated compressions.

Scientific progress often involves expanding scope (upward) and increasing integration (rightward).

This geometric representation is itself a compression—useful pedagogically, not ontologically final.

## 7. Explanatory vs. Engineering Modeling

### 7.1 Explanatory Modeling

Aims at structural adequacy.

- Expands scope  
- Integrates domains  
- Detects deep constraints  

Permeability is mandatory.

---

### 7.2 Engineering Modeling

Aims at functional reliability.

- Restricts scope  
- Enforces boundary conditions  
- Designs safety margins  

Closure is strategic, but safety factors implicitly acknowledge unscoped interaction.

---

## 8. Non-Teleological Realism

Interactional Epistemics rejects:

- Final enumeration  
- Guaranteed convergence to a single ultimate carving  
- Teleological certainty  

It affirms:

- Structured reality  
- Constraint-driven convergence  
- Expanding domains of stability  

Deep structure, if it exists, appears as invariance across expanding interaction—not as a final object inventory.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Empirical models are local compressions of interacting structure. They arise through selective enumeration within combinatorially vast possibility spaces.

Because:

- Partition space is combinatorial  
- Structural arrangements are underdetermined by finite data  
- Finite agents cannot guarantee interactional exhaustiveness  

No model can justifiably claim ontological closure.

Scientific progress becomes adaptive stabilization under constraint.

Understanding expands not by finalizing structure, but by surviving broader exposure.

**Final Thesis:**  
A model becomes dogmatic when it denies the possibility that real structure exists beyond its scoped description.

Interactional Epistemics replaces the search for final enumeration with disciplined openness under constraint.
