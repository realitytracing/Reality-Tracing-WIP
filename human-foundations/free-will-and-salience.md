# Free Will and Salience

## Status and Intent

This document clarifies how **free will** is treated within a constraint-aware, reality-tracing framework.

It does **not** attempt to resolve the metaphysical question of whether free will exists.

Instead, it accounts for how **agency appears, functions, and remains usable** under real constraints such as finite energy, rate limits, overload, and irreversibility.

This framework prioritizes **behavior under pressure** over ontological certainty.

## Salience as the Primary Dynamic

Salience is the ongoing **directional flow of finite energy** toward locally sustaining ends.

It is visible only in motion and cannot be frozen into a static definition.

Salience emerges from the interaction of:
- Constraints  
- History  
- Bias  
- Chance  
- Current conditions  

Habituation stabilizes salient paths temporarily by reducing energetic cost and variance. All stability remains **relative and revisable** under changing constraints.

Salience operates continuously and automatically. It does not require conscious choice to function.

## The Question of Free Will

Within this framework, free will is **not treated as a necessary first cause**, sovereign chooser, or external controller of action.

Introducing such a construct would conflict with:
- Constraint awareness  
- Energy limits  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Lived experience under load  

At the same time, the **experience of agency** is real, persistent, and operationally significant.

The framework therefore allows multiple compatible interpretations of free will **without forcing premature closure**.

## Three Compatible Readings

### 1. Pure Salience  
*(Fully Naturalistic Reading)*

All action, reflection, hesitation, and change arise from emergent weighted dynamics under constraint.

What is commonly described as “choice” is a descriptive label applied to shifts in salience trajectories.

In this reading:
- Free will is not required  
- Reflection is another energetic process  
- Agency is an explanatory convenience, not a cause  

Behavior remains fully accounted for.

### 2. Congenital Twin  
*(Pragmatic / Phenomenological Reading)*

Salience provides continuous direction, while free will co-emerges as a **constrained capacity** to locally redirect salience through reflection, interruption, and experimentation.

In this reading:
- Free will is real but limited  
- It is expensive, intermittent, and unevenly available  
- It introduces local perturbations rather than global control  

Salience dominates; free will nudges.

---

### 3. Open Twin / Stopping-Rule  
*(Non-Closed Assumption)*

Whether free will exists or not is left undecided.

The experience of agency is treated as an **adaptive cognitive stopping rule**.

Human abstraction enables recursive self-questioning. Without a stopping rule, cognition risks:
- Infinite regress  
- Paralysis  
- Failure to act under uncertainty  

Attributing action to a self allows commitment, learning, and coordination to proceed despite incomplete information.

In this reading:
- Agency may be real or illusory  
- Its function is necessary either way  
- Action proceeds under uncertainty  

---

## Operational Indistinguishability

These interpretations coexist because they behave **identically** under the constraints relevant to:
- Action  
- Adaptation  
- Collapse  
- Recovery  

For the purposes of reality tracing:
- Energy limits remain unchanged  
- Salience dynamics remain unchanged  
- Habituation remains unchanged  
- Overload and failure modes remain unchanged  

Collapsing a fundamental uncertainty where **no operational difference exists** constitutes epistemic overreach.

---

## Agency, Responsibility, and Constraint

Responsibility within this framework is **contextual rather than absolute**.

Agency is:
- Graded  
- Capacity-dependent  
- Sensitive to overload, coercion, deprivation, and constraint  

This avoids:
- Moral absolutism  
- Total denial of agency  
- Blame detached from lived constraint  

Care, boundaries, and accountability remain compatible with constraint awareness.

---

## Summary

Salience is the primary directional dynamic.

Free will may be understood as:
- **Unnecessary** (pure salience)  
- **Emergent leverage** (congenital twin)  
- **A necessary stopping rule under uncertainty** (open twin)  

The framework does not require free will to be metaphysically real.

It requires only that **action, learning, and coordination remain possible under incomplete information**.

Reality tracing privileges what continues to function under constraint over claims of ultimate causation.
