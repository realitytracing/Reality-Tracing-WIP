# Free Will and Salience

This document clarifies how free will is treated within a constraint-aware, reality-tracing framework. It does not attempt to resolve the metaphysical question of whether free will exists. Instead, it accounts for how agency appears, functions, and remains usable under real constraints.

The framework prioritizes behavior under pressure over ontological certainty.

## Salience as the Primary Dynamic

Salience is the ongoing directional flow of finite energy toward locally sustaining ends. It is visible only in motion and cannot be frozen into a static definition. Salience emerges from the interaction of constraints, history, bias, chance, and current conditions.

Habituation stabilizes salient paths temporarily by reducing energetic cost and variance. All stability remains relative and revisable under changing constraints.

Salience operates continuously, automatically, and without requiring conscious choice.

## The Question of Free Will

Within this framework, free will is not treated as a necessary first cause, sovereign chooser, or external controller of action. Introducing such a construct would conflict with constraint awareness, energy limits, and lived experience.

At the same time, the experience of agency is real, persistent, and operationally significant. The framework therefore allows multiple compatible interpretations of free will without collapsing them prematurely.

## Three Compatible Readings

### 1. Pure Salience (Fully Naturalistic Reading)

All action, reflection, hesitation, and change arise from emergent weighted dynamics under constraint. What is commonly described as “choice” is a descriptive label applied to shifts in salience trajectories.

In this reading:
- Free will is not required
- Reflection is another energetic process
- Agency is an explanatory convenience, not a cause

Behavior remains fully accounted for.

---

### 2. Congenital Twin Reading (Pragmatic / Phenomenological)

Salience provides continuous direction, while free will co-emerges as a constrained capacity to locally redirect salience through reflection, interruption, and experimentation.

In this reading:
- Free will is real but limited
- It is expensive, intermittent, and unevenly available
- It introduces local perturbations rather than control

Salience dominates; free will nudges.

---

### 3. Open Twin / Stopping-Rule Reading (Non-Closed Assumption)

Whether free will exists or not is left undecided. The experience of agency is treated as an adaptive cognitive stopping rule.

Human abstraction enables recursive self-questioning. Without a stopping rule, cognition risks infinite regress, paralysis, and failure to act under uncertainty. Attributing action to a self allows commitment, learning, and coordination to proceed despite incomplete information.

In this reading:
- Agency may be real or illusory
- Its function is necessary either way
- Action proceeds under uncertainty

---

## Operational Indistinguishability

These interpretations coexist because they behave identically under the constraints relevant to action, adaptation, collapse, and recovery.

For the purposes of reality tracing:
- Energy limits remain unchanged
- Salience dynamics remain unchanged
- Habituation remains unchanged
- Overload and failure modes remain unchanged

Collapsing a fundamental uncertainty where no operational difference exists constitutes epistemic overreach.

---

## Agency, Responsibility, and Constraint

Responsibility within this framework is contextual rather than absolute. Agency is graded, capacity-dependent, and sensitive to overload, coercion, and deprivation.

This avoids:
- moral absolutism
- total denial of agency
- blame detached from constraint

Care, boundaries, and accountability remain compatible with constraint awareness.

---

## Summary

Salience is the primary directional dynamic. Free will may be understood as:
- unnecessary (pure salience),
- emergent leverage (congenital twin),
- or a necessary stopping rule under uncertainty (open twin).

The framework does not require free will to be metaphysically real. It requires only that action, learning, and coordination can proceed under incomplete information.

Reality tracing privileges what continues to function under constraint over claims of ultimate causation.
