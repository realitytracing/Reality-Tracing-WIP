# Dynamics

## Systems in Motion

This framework treats human cognition, behavior, and social systems as **dynamic processes** rather than static traits, identities, or states.

What matters is not what a system *is*, but how it:
- Moves  
- Stabilizes  
- Overloads  
- Adapts  
- Fails  
- Recovers  

Systems do not occupy fixed positions.  
They **move within bounded constraint space**.

Dynamics describe how systems change under pressure.

## Core Dynamic Properties

Key dynamic properties include:
- **Energy and capacity flow**  
- **Rate sensitivity**  
- **Feedback and threshold effects**  
- **Emergence and decay**  
- **Relative stability rather than permanence**

Energy is not singular.  
It manifests through motion, interaction, attention, cognition, emotion, and coordination.

Capacity limits—cognitive, emotional, temporal, biological—govern *how* energy can move.

These properties govern behavior across individual, social, and institutional layers.

## Salience as Motion

Salience is visible only through movement. It cannot be frozen into a static state or reduced to a single mechanism.

It appears as the **directional flow of energy and capacity toward locally sustaining ends**, stabilizing through habituation and dissolving under overload or constraint violation.

Salience is therefore not a trait.  
It is a **trajectory**.

---

## Initialization and Relative Stability

Initialization of salient paths is contingent and partially chaotic. It arises from the totality of:
- Passive biases  
- Active attention  
- Contextual cues  
- Chance interactions  

No salient configuration is guaranteed or final.

Stability emerges only later—and only **relatively**—through repeated traversal and habituation. All stability remains conditional on continued constraint alignment.

Systems are always *wiggling* inside their allowed space.

---

## Overload as Rate Violation

Overload occurs when the **rate of demand** exceeds available capacity.

This includes:
- Emotional overload  
- Cognitive overload  
- Sensory overload  
- Coordination overload  

These are not character flaws or moral failures.  
They are **rate violations**.

The system enforces correction through:
- Fatigue  
- Distress  
- Numbing  
- Disengagement  

These responses reduce load when voluntary regulation fails.

---

## Loss of Local Ends and Transition States

Loss, blockage, or collapse of local ends destabilizes salience.

When existing ends no longer absorb energy or capacity:
- Orientation weakens  
- Restraint erodes  
- Affect intensifies  

Disorientation, anger, or agitation often appear as salience searches for new viable trajectories.

This liminal state is not failure.  
It is a **transition phase** between stabilizing structures.

---

## Artificial Constraints and Dynamic Distortion

Not all constraints are enforced by reality.

Some constraints are **artificial**: imposed by other agents’ abstractions of real constraints.

Examples include:
- Performance metrics treated as survival requirements  
- Moralized productivity standards  
- Identity-level success narratives  
- Abstract optimization targets detached from lived capacity  

Artificial constraints do not change physics or biology.  
They change **where systems are allowed to move**.

They introduce:
- Walls where none are enforced by reality  
- Landmines inside otherwise viable option space  
- Increased rate pressure without increased capacity  

Dynamics under artificial constraint show:
- Earlier overload  
- Narrowed trajectories  
- Premature collapse  
- Misattributed failure  

The system still obeys real constraints.  
It simply collides with them sooner.

---

## Diversity of Salience and Failure Modes

Human systems exhibit unusually high diversity in:
- Salience patterns  
- Ideas and values  
- Local ends  

This diversity arises from passive subjectivity and bias rather than uniform instinctive programming.

From an evolutionary perspective, this produces not only diversity of behavior, but **diversity of failure modes**.

---

## Decorrelation and Survivability

Diverse failure modes reduce correlated collapse.

When individuals and groups differ in:
- What they find salient  
- How they allocate energy and capacity  
- Which local ends they pursue  

shocks do not propagate uniformly across the population.

Uniform salience increases efficiency under stable conditions but amplifies fragility under shock.

---

## Example: Uniform Salience as Fragility

Consider a hypothetical population in which all humans are highly social extroverts.

During a pandemic, such uniform salience would strongly bias behavior toward social gathering, accelerating transmission and increasing mortality.

Real human populations include:
- Introversion  
- Caution  
- Risk aversion  
- Withdrawal  
- Disengagement  

These patterns slow collapse even when no single strategy is optimal.

This diversity is not a moral virtue or cultural accident.  
It is an **evolutionary allowance** that increases survivability by decorrelating failure pathways.

---

## Dynamics Over Static Explanation

Dynamics govern collapse and recovery.

Static explanations obscure:
- How pressure accumulates  
- Where thresholds lie  
- When transitions occur  
- Why recovery sometimes fails  

Understanding systems requires tracking **movement, rate, and enforcement**, not static labels.

---

## Excess Capacity as a Destabilizing Condition

Instability does not arise only from scarcity.

Excess available capacity—when insufficiently absorbed by existing structures—can also destabilize systems.

In human systems, this appears as **salience volatility rather than overload**:
- Capacity exceeds stabilizing paths  
- Churn replaces collapse  
- Switching replaces exhaustion  

This condition is nonlinear and context-dependent.

Increasing ease, efficiency, or availability does not monotonically increase stability. Beyond certain thresholds, it can **undermine stabilization by reducing absorption capacity**.

---

## Summary

Human systems are governed by dynamic interaction between:
- Energy and capacity flow  
- Rate limits  
- Salience stabilization  
- Habituation  
- Local ends  

Both scarcity and surplus can produce instability when capacity is mismatched with stabilizing structures.

Dynamics determine whether systems:
- Adapt  
- Fracture  
- Collapse  
- Recover  

Static descriptions explain *what is*.  
Dynamics explain **what happens under pressure**.
