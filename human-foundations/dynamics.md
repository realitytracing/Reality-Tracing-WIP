# Dynamics

This framework treats human cognition, behavior, and social systems as dynamic processes rather than static traits or identities.

Key dynamic properties include:
- Energy flow and depletion
- Rate sensitivity
- Feedback and threshold effects
- Emergence and decay
- Relative stability rather than permanence

Salience is visible only through movement. It cannot be frozen into a state or reduced to a single mechanism. It appears as the directional flow of energy toward locally sustaining ends, stabilizing through habituation and dissolving under overload or constraint violation.

Initialization of salient paths is contingent and chaotic, arising from the totality of passive and active biases present at a given moment. Stability emerges only later, and only relatively.

Overload occurs when the rate of energy demand exceeds processing capacity. Emotional overload, cognitive overload, and sensory overload are rate violations, not character flaws. The system enforces correction through fatigue, distress, or disengagement.

Loss of local ends produces disorientation and anger as salience searches for new viable trajectories. This liminal state is a transition, not a failure.

### Diversity of Salience and Failure Modes

Human systems exhibit an unusually high diversity of salience, ideas, and local ends. This diversity arises from passive subjectivity and bias rather than uniform instinctive programming. From an evolutionary perspective, this produces not only diversity of behavior, but diversity of failure modes.

Diverse failure modes reduce correlated collapse. When individuals and groups differ in what they find salient, how they allocate energy, and which local ends they pursue, shocks do not propagate uniformly across the population.

As a counterexample, consider a hypothetical population in which all humans are highly social extroverts. During a pandemic, such uniform salience would strongly bias behavior toward social gathering, accelerating transmission and increasing mortality. In contrast, real human populations contain introversion, caution, risk aversion, withdrawal, and disengagement as viable patterns. These differences slow collapse even when no single strategy is optimal.

This diversity is not a moral virtue or cultural accident. It is an evolutionary allowance that increases system survivability by decorrelating failure pathways. Uniform salience increases efficiency under stable conditions but amplifies fragility under shock.

Dynamics govern collapse and recovery. Static explanations obscure how systems actually change under pressure.

### Excess Energy as a Destabilizing Condition

Instability does not arise only from scarcity. Excess available energy, when insufficiently absorbed by existing structures, can destabilize systems.

In human systems, this appears as salience volatility rather than overload. Energy exceeds the stabilizing capacity of local ends, producing churn rather than collapse.

This condition is nonlinear and context-dependent. Increasing ease or efficiency does not monotonically increase stability.
