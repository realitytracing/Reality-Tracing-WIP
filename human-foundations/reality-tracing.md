# Reality Tracing

## Intent

Reality Tracing is a **practice**, not a theory and not an ontology of everything.

Its purpose is to trace constraints, flows, and limits across human-scale emergent systems (cognition, identity, culture, institutions) while explicitly refusing overreach.

Reality Tracing exists to fill a missing discipline:

- One that treats human systems as real and causal  
- Without pretending they can be fully formalized or closed  
- Without declaring them ineffable or beyond analysis  

It applies the same epistemic restraint learned in physics to higher emergent realities.

---

## What Reality Tracing Is Not

Reality Tracing is not:

- A total explanation of humans  
- A replacement for psychology, neuroscience, sociology, economics, law, or governance  
- A moral framework  
- A predictive engine  
- A claim about ultimate metaphysics  

It does not explain what humans *are*.  
It traces what humans are **constrained by**.

---

## Core Stance

### 1. Constraints Are Primary

Reality Tracing begins from the assumption that:

- We are constrained agents inside the system we are trying to understand  
- Energy, attention, salience, habituation, incentives, embodiment, and history impose limits  

Constraints are treated as first-class objects.

Models come second.

### 2. Bayesian Reasoning Is Local, Not Final

Bayesian reasoning is extremely useful when:

- The hypothesis space is known  
- The frame is stable  
- Compression is required  

But Reality Tracing recognizes a non-Bayesian boundary:

- The space of possible ideas, causes, and interpretations is not enumerable  
- New salience objects and categories can emerge  
- Frames themselves can break  

Therefore:

- Bayesian reasoning works **within frames**  
- Reality Tracing governs when frames are incomplete or unstable  

Bayes is a tool of constrained minds.  
It is not an ontology of reality.

### 3. Salience Governs Action

Reality Tracing treats salience as the primary regulator of behavior:

- Anything in the mind can become an idea  
- Ideas, feelings, sensations, memories, and meta-ideas can become salient  
- Salience determines what receives energy and action  

Habituation stabilizes salience over time, preventing infinite loops.

This explains:

- Habit formation  
- Bias stabilization  
- Identity consolidation  
- Burnout  
- Overthinking  
- Social contagion  

Without invoking essence or moral failure.

### 4. Micro-Interactions Accumulate Without Total Causation

Every interaction leaves some trace.

Most dissipate.  
Some amplify through salience and reinforcement.

No single event can be shown to be globally causative of a person.

Because:

- Amplification is nonlinear  
- Countervailing interactions arrive unpredictably  
- The full interaction space is unknowable  

Reality Tracing allows partial causation.  
It forbids total explanation.

---

### 5. Biology Bounds; It Does Not Dictate

Biological diversity shapes:

- What can become salient  
- How salience is constructed  
- How quickly habituation occurs  

But differences in sensory channel, embodiment, or processing do not prevent participation in higher emergent layers.

Salience operates on representations, not raw signals.

Biology constrains possibility space.  
It does not fully script identity or meaning.

---

### 6. Identity Is Emergent, Not Sacred or Reducible

Identity (including gender) is understood as:

- A stabilized bundle of salient representations  
- Reinforced by habit, social feedback, embodiment, and history  

Reality Tracing:

- Does not deny identity  
- Does not reduce identity to biology  
- Does not elevate identity to metaphysical ontology  

It traces identity as an emergent constraint configuration.

---

## Why This Practice Is Needed

Without a named discipline:

- Human sciences may be dismissed as unreal by outsiders  
- Practitioners may overclaim and slide into ontology  

Reality Tracing creates a shared stopping rule:

- These systems are real  
- These explanations are partial  
- These models do not close reality  

This prevents both:

- Romantic anti-formalization  
- Scientistic overreach  

---

## Social Function

Reality Tracing provides a shared language that allows people to:

- Disagree without total blame  
- Explain without single-cause narratives  
- Argue within constraints  
- Recognize uncertainty without paralysis  

It shifts discourse from:

- Finger-pointing  
- Essence claims  
- Moral totalization  

Toward:

- Constraint analysis  
- Salience mismatches  
- Incentive structures  
- Historical contingency  

---

## Minimal Ontological Claim

Reality Tracing makes only one ontological commitment:

> What we can legitimately trace is not reality in itself, but the constraints that shape our access to it.

This is an ontology of limits, not of substances.

---

## Representation Analogy

Reality Tracing resembles sketching a three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional surface.

Fidelity does not come from reproducing every surface, but from knowing:

- Which lines can be drawn without distortion  
- Which must be left blank  

Gaps in the trace are not ignorance or omission.  
They mark the honest boundary of representation.

Attempting to fill them prematurely produces coherence loss rather than understanding.

---

## In Short

Reality Tracing is:

- Formal without being total  
- Real without being reductionist  
- Humble without being dismissive  
- Analytical without being dehumanizing  

It applies epistemic discipline to higher emergent realities.

Nothing more. Nothing less.
