## Why a New Psychology Is Required

Classical psychology inherited two structural failures:

1. **Static categorization** (traits, disorders, identities)
2. **Moralized deviation** (normal vs abnormal, healthy vs unhealthy)

These models fail under pressure because they:
- Treat behavior as intrinsic rather than contextual
- Ignore energy, rate, and locality constraints
- Confuse stability with health
- Attempt suppression instead of redirection

Reality Tracing requires a psychology that:
- Remains valid under overload
- Explains stability of maladaptive patterns
- Preserves agency without metaphysical claims
- Treats failure modes as information, not defects

This document re-emerges psychology as a **dynamic, metabolic system**.

---

## Core Premise

The human mind is an **energy-regulating system** operating under:
- Finite metabolic budget
- Rate limits
- Irreversibility
- Unenumerable uncertainty
- Filtered by locality (biology + environment)
-Salience structures

Psychological phenomena are not traits.
They are **patterns of energy routing and stabilization**.

---

## Salience as the Central Psychological Variable

Salience is the directional flow of finite energy toward local ends.

Psychology emerges from:
- What becomes salient
- How salience stabilizes
- Where energy is sunk
- When routing fails

Emotion, motivation, identity, and behavior are **expressions of salience dynamics**, not independent modules.

---

## Mental States as Dynamic Regimes

Mental states are not discrete conditions.
They are **regimes** produced by interaction between:

- Energy availability
- Local threat/noise
- Habituation depth
- Local ends viability

Examples:
- Anxiety = hyper-vigilant salience under uncertainty
- Depression = salience collapse after loss of viable ends
- Mania = salience overflow under excess energy and low friction (both in locality and in salience structure)
- Dissociation = protective salience withdrawal under overload

These are not pathologies by default.
They are **adaptive responses that may become non-viable**.

---

## Pathology Reframed: The Stability of the Sink

Pathology is a **stable energy sink** that persists because it works.

A pathological pattern:
- Absorbs excess energy
- Prevents salience meltdown
- Provides false closure
- Becomes deeply habituated 

This explains:
- Addiction
- Compulsions
- Ideological fixation
- Identity hardening
- Self-harm loops

Pathologies are not chosen.
They are **selected under constraint**.

---

## Diagnosis Without Labels

Diagnosis is not classification.
It is **flow tracing**.

Key questions:
- What energy is entering the system?
- Where is it being sunk?
- What alternatives are blocked?
- What would happen if this sink were removed?

This replaces:
> “What disorder is this?”

with:
> “What function is this pattern performing?”

---

## Recovery as Salience Re-Routing

Recovery is not normalization or correction.
It is **finding a higher-efficiency sink**.

Recovery requires:
- Lower transformation cost
- Comparable energy absorption
- Safer locality
- Time for habituation

Suppression without replacement causes rebound.
Moral pressure increases instability.
Recovery is probabilistic, not linear.

---

## Legitimacy, Trust, and Mental Stability

Psychological stability depends on perceived legitimacy of:
- Internal narratives
- External systems
- Authority structures
- Future expectations

When legitimacy erodes:
- Cognitive load increases
- Paranoia becomes adaptive
- Trust collapses into self-only models

Mental distress often mirrors **institutional misalignment**, not internal defect.

---

## Individual Psychology Is Not Isolated

The mind is embedded in:
- Families
- Economies
- Media systems
- Governance
- Cultural salience fields

Psychological failure often indicates **systemic overload** being absorbed by individuals.

Treating individuals alone while leaving systems unchanged externalizes cost unfairly.

---

## Why This Is Still Psychology

This framework:
- Explains behavior
- Predicts failure modes
- Guides intervention
- Preserves compassion
- Avoids metaphysical claims

But it does not:
- Freeze people into labels
- Promise permanent health
- Confuse stability with virtue

It is psychology **for finite agents**, not ideal ones.

---

## Status Reminder

This is not a closed theory.
It is a working compression.

If future observation shows mismatch between:
- predicted energy flows
- observed stabilization
- lived experience

then this psychology must be revised or discarded.

Reality tracing applies to psychology as much as anything else.
