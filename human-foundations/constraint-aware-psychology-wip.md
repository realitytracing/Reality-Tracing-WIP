## Re-emergent Mental Dynamics Under Energy, Salience, and Locality

# 1. Purpose

This document re-derives psychology as a **dynamic metabolic system under constraint**.

It does not:
- Freeze behavior into static traits
- Moralize deviation
- Claim ontological finality
- Replace clinical expertise

It provides a **dynamic compression layer** that:
- Explains stability of maladaptive patterns
- Remains valid under overload
- Preserves agency without metaphysical claims
- Treats failure modes as constraint signals

---

# 2. Core Premise

The human mind functions as an **energy-regulating system** operating under:

- Finite metabolic budget
- Finite attention
- Finite cognitive capacity
- Finite emotional bandwidth
- Rate sensitivity
- Irreversibility
- Incomplete information
- Locality (biology + environment)

Psychological phenomena are not traits.

They are **patterns of energy routing, stabilization, and enforcement under constraint**.

---

# 3. The Trilateral Constraint Loop

Mental stability emerges from negotiation between three constraint-bearing systems:

## 3.1 Biological Signaling (The Alarm)

Regulatory gradients enforcing:
- Homeostasis
- Rate limits
- Threat prioritization
- Recovery need

Signals include:
- Reward (reinforcement gradients)
- Negative affect (rate violation signals)
- Inhibitory clamps (freeze, shutdown)
- Allowance windows (temporary strain tolerance)

Biology does not negotiate indefinitely.

---

## 3.2 Habituated Memory (The Recorder)

Previously stabilized paths that:
- Reduce transformation cost
- Encode expectations
- Narrow variance
- Bias interpretation

Habituation:
- Deepens attractor basins
- Lowers traversal cost
- Narrows optionality

All stability remains conditional.

---

## 3.3 Present-Moment Locality (The Terrain)

Immediate constraint field including:
- Physical conditions
- Social dynamics
- Informational load
- Friction and opportunity
- Legitimacy structures
- Recovery channels

Locality continuously reshapes reachable state-space.

---

# 4. Salience as Dynamic Routing

Salience is the **directional flow of finite capacity toward local ends**.

It is not:
- Emotion
- Thought
- Identity
- Choice

It is the dynamic weighting across all of them.

Salience is shaped by:
- Biological gradient state
- Habituation depth
- Locality pressure
- Energy availability

It exists only in motion.

---

# 5. Gradient Dynamics

The system operates on **continuous gradients**, not binary states.

Gradients include:
- Threat gain
- Reward slope
- Exploration bandwidth
- Energy envelope
- Tolerance window

Gradients tighten and loosen moment-to-moment based on:

Biology × Locality × Current Salience Structure

There is no neutral baseline — only current configuration.

---

# 6. Mental States as Regimes

Mental states are **regimes**, not fixed categories.

Examples (structural, not diagnostic):

- Anxiety → Hyper-vigilant salience under uncertainty
- Depression → Salience collapse after loss of viable local ends
- Mania → Salience overflow under high energy and low friction
- Dissociation → Protective withdrawal under overload

These are adaptive configurations that may become non-viable.

---

# 7. Pathology as Modeled Pattern

At model scale:

There is no intrinsic pathology.

There are only recurring dynamic configurations.

In practice:

> “X pattern of dynamics” is what we tend to call “Y pathology.”

Pathology is a socially stabilized label for recurring high-risk regimes under constraint.

The model describes:
- Elasticity reduction
- Collapse risk
- Deepened attractor basins
- Loss of viable option space

It does not assign identity.

---

# 8. Overload and Failure

Overload occurs when:

Rate of demand > Available capacity

Forms include:
- Emotional overload
- Cognitive overload
- Sensory overload
- Social overload

Enforcement signals:
- Distress
- Fatigue
- Withdrawal
- Numbing
- Agitation

These indicate constraint conflict, not moral defect.

---

# 9. The Stability of the Sink

Maladaptive patterns persist because they function.

A “pathological” pattern often:

- Absorbs excess energy
- Reduces uncertainty
- Provides closure
- Becomes deeply habituated

Examples:
- Addiction
- Compulsion
- Ideological fixation
- Identity hardening
- Self-harm loops

These stabilize locally while increasing long-term fragility.

---

# 10. Recovery as Re-Routing

Recovery is not normalization.

It is:

- Re-routing energy into a more viable sink
- Lowering transformation cost
- Expanding elasticity
- Restoring recovery bandwidth

Suppression without replacement increases instability.

Recovery is:
- Nonlinear
- Rate-limited
- Probabilistic

---

# 11. Elasticity as Functional Health

Health is not “neutral.”

Health is:

- Gradient flexibility
- Regime shift capacity
- Re-expansion after contraction
- Multi-capacity balance

Temporary rigidity is adaptive.

Persistent loss of re-expansion capacity increases collapse risk.

---

# 12. Embeddedness

No mind is isolated.

The system is embedded within:

- Family structures
- Economies
- Media ecosystems
- Governance systems
- Cultural salience fields

Individual distress may reflect systemic overload.

Intervention must consider locality, not only internal routing.

---

# 13. Diagnostic Practice Boundary

This framework:

- Models dynamic regimes
- Traces energy flow
- Identifies collapse risk

It does not replace clinical judgment.

Intervention thresholds remain:
- Practitioner-determined
- Context-dependent
- Risk-sensitive

Disagreement should be resolved through:
- Structural tracing
- Gradient analysis
- Elasticity assessment
- Locality examination

---

# 14. Provisional Status

This is a working compression.

If consistent mismatch appears between:

- Predicted energy routing
- Observed stabilization
- Lived experience

The framework must be revised or discarded.

No model is exempt from constraint.

Reality tracing applies here as well.
