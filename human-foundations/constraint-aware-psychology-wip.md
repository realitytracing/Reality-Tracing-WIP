## Re-emergent Mental Dynamics Under Energy, Salience, and Locality

**Status:** Foundational Artifact  
**Scope:** Psychology, mental health, behavior, adaptation under constraint  
**Position:** Re-derived from Reality Tracing, not imported

## Why a Re-Derived Psychology Is Necessary

Classical psychology often inherits two structural tendencies:

1. **Static categorization** (traits, disorders, identities as fixed entities)  
2. **Moralized deviation** (normal vs abnormal, healthy vs unhealthy)

These models frequently fail under sustained pressure because they:

- Treat behavior as intrinsic rather than contextual  
- Under-model energy, rate, and locality constraints  
- Confuse stability with health  
- Attempt suppression rather than redirection  

Reality Tracing requires a psychology that:

- Remains valid under overload  
- Explains the stability of maladaptive patterns  
- Preserves agency without metaphysical claims  
- Treats failure modes as information, not defects  

This document re-derives psychology as a **dynamic metabolic system under constraint**.

---

## Core Premise

The human mind functions as an **energy-regulating system** operating under:

- Finite metabolic budget  
- Rate limits  
- Irreversibility  
- Unenumerable uncertainty  
- Locality (biology + environment)  
- Salience structure  

Psychological phenomena are not traits.

They are **patterns of energy routing, stabilization, and enforcement under constraint**.

---

## Salience as the Central Psychological Variable

Salience is the directional flow of finite energy toward local ends.

Psychology emerges from:

- What becomes salient  
- How salience stabilizes  
- Where energy is sunk  
- When routing fails  

Emotion, motivation, identity, and behavior are not independent modules.

They are **expressions of salience dynamics interacting with constraint**.

## The Trilateral Constraint Loop

The mind is not a sovereign commander.  
It is a participant in a trilateral signaling loop.

Stability is not the absence of pain.  
It is successful negotiation among three constraint-bearing systems:

### 1. Biological Signaling (The Alarm)
Hard-wired reward and aversion signals enforcing:
- Homeostasis  
- Rate limits  
- Survival priorities  

### 2. Habituated Memory (The Recorder)
Previously stabilized paths that:
- Reduce transformation cost  
- Encode expectations  
- Narrow variance  
- Bias interpretation  

### 3. Present-Moment Locality (The Terrain)
Immediate:
- Physical conditions  
- Social dynamics  
- Informational load  
- Friction and opportunity  

Mental distress often arises when these systems de-sync.

Examples:
- Salience overriding biological rate limits  
- Locality demanding adaptation faster than habituation can support  
- Habituated paths resisting necessary reweighting  

Distress signals constraint conflict, not intrinsic defect.

## Mental States as Dynamic Regimes

Mental states are not discrete categories.

They are **regimes** emerging from interaction among:

- Energy availability  
- Locality pressure (threat, noise, demand)  
- Habituation depth  
- Biological signaling intensity  
- Viability of local ends  

Examples (structural, not diagnostic):

- **Anxiety:** Hyper-vigilant salience under uncertainty and perceived threat  
- **Depression:** Salience collapse following loss of viable local ends  
- **Mania:** Salience overflow under high energy and low friction  
- **Dissociation:** Protective salience withdrawal under overload  

These states are not inherently pathological.

They are adaptive configurations that may become non-viable.

---

## Pathology Reframed: The Stability of the Sink

Pathology can be understood as a **stable energy sink** that persists because it functions.

A maladaptive pattern often:

- Absorbs excess energy  
- Prevents salience fragmentation  
- Provides closure under uncertainty  
- Becomes deeply habituated  

This reframes phenomena such as:

- Addiction  
- Compulsion  
- Ideological fixation  
- Identity hardening  
- Self-harm loops  

These patterns are not selected for virtue or vice.

They are selected under constraint because they stabilize energy flow.

---

## Diagnosis as Flow Tracing

Diagnosis becomes **flow tracing**, not labeling.

Key questions:

- What energy is entering the system?  
- Where is it being routed?  
- What function does this pattern serve?  
- What alternatives are blocked or too costly?  
- What would happen if this sink were removed?  

This replaces:

> “What disorder is this?”

with:

> “What regulatory function is this pattern performing?”

---

## Recovery as Salience Re-Routing

Recovery is not normalization.

It is **re-routing energy into a more viable sink**.

Recovery requires:

- Lower transformation cost  
- Comparable absorption capacity  
- Supportive locality  
- Time for new habituation  

Suppression without replacement increases instability.  
Moral pressure amplifies load.

Recovery is probabilistic, nonlinear, and rate-limited.

---

## Legitimacy, Trust, and Psychological Stability

Psychological stability depends partly on perceived legitimacy of:

- Internal narratives  
- External institutions  
- Authority structures  
- Future trajectories  

When legitimacy erodes:

- Cognitive load increases  
- Hypervigilance may become adaptive  
- Trust collapses into self-only models  

Mental distress may reflect systemic misalignment, not purely internal dysfunction.

---

## Embeddedness: No Isolated Minds

The mind is embedded within:

- Families  
- Economies  
- Media systems  
- Governance structures  
- Cultural salience fields  

Psychological failure frequently indicates systemic overload being absorbed at the individual level.

Treating individuals in isolation while leaving structural overload unchanged externalizes cost.

---

## Why This Remains Psychology

This framework:

- Explains behavior dynamically  
- Predicts failure modes under constraint  
- Guides intervention via flow tracing  
- Preserves compassion without moralization  
- Avoids metaphysical closure  

It does not:

- Freeze people into static labels  
- Promise permanent equilibrium  
- Confuse stability with virtue  

It is psychology for finite agents under real constraints.

---

## Status Reminder

This is not a closed theory.

It is a working compression.

If observation shows mismatch between:

- Predicted energy routing  
- Observed stabilization  
- Lived experience  

then this framework must be revised or discarded.

Reality Tracing applies to psychology as much as to any other domain.
