## Re-emergent Mental Dynamics Under Energy, Salience, and Locality

---

# 1. Purpose

This document re-derives psychology as a dynamic metabolic system operating under constraint.

It does not:

- Freeze behavior into static traits  
- Moralize deviation  
- Claim ontological finality  
- Replace clinical expertise  

It provides a dynamic compression layer that:

- Explains the stability of maladaptive patterns  
- Remains valid under overload  
- Preserves agency without metaphysical claims  
- Treats failure modes as constraint signals  

---

# 2. Core Premise

The human mind functions as an energy-regulating system operating under:

- Finite metabolic budget  
- Finite attention  
- Finite cognitive capacity  
- Finite emotional bandwidth  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Irreversibility  
- Incomplete information  
- Locality (biology + environment)  

Psychological phenomena are not traits.

They are patterns of energy routing, stabilization, and enforcement under constraint.

# 3. The Trilateral Salience Constraint Loop

Mental stability emerges from negotiation between three constraint-bearing systems:

## 3.1 Biological Signaling (The Alarm)

Regulatory gradients enforcing:

- Homeostasis  
- Rate limits  
- Threat prioritization  
- Recovery need  

Signals include:

- Reward (reinforcement gradients)  
- Negative affect (rate violation signals)  
- Inhibitory clamps (freeze, shutdown)  
- Allowance windows (temporary strain tolerance)  

Biology does not negotiate indefinitely.

When gradients are violated persistently, enforcement escalates.

---

## 3.2 Habituated Memory (The Recorder)

Previously stabilized paths that:

- Reduce transformation cost  
- Encode expectations  
- Narrow variance  
- Bias interpretation  

Habituation:

- Deepens attractor basins  
- Lowers traversal cost  
- Narrows optionality  

All stability remains conditional.

---

## 3.3 Present-Moment Locality (The Terrain)

Immediate constraint field including:

- Physical conditions  
- Social dynamics  
- Informational load  
- Friction and opportunity  
- Legitimacy structures  
- Recovery channels  

Locality continuously reshapes reachable state-space.

---

# 4. Salience as Dynamic Routing

Salience is the directional flow of finite capacity toward local ends.

It is not:

- Emotion  
- Thought  
- Identity  
- Choice  

It is the dynamic weighting across all of them.

Salience is shaped by:

- Biological gradient state  
- Habituation depth  
- Locality pressure  
- Energy availability  

Salience exists only in motion.

---

# 5. Gradient Dynamics

The system operates on continuous gradients, not binary states.

Gradients include:

- Threat gain  
- Reward slope  
- Exploration bandwidth  
- Energy envelope  
- Tolerance window  

Gradients tighten and loosen moment-to-moment based on:

Biology × Locality × Current Salience Structure

There is no neutral baseline — only current configuration.

---

# 6. Mental States as Regimes

Mental states are regimes, not fixed categories.

Examples (structural, not diagnostic):

- Anxiety → Hyper-vigilant salience under uncertainty  
- Depression → Salience collapse after loss of viable local ends  
- Mania → Salience overflow under high energy and low friction  
- Dissociation → Protective withdrawal under overload  

These are adaptive configurations that may become non-viable under shifting constraints.

---

# 7. Pathology as Dynamic Configuration

At model scale, there is no intrinsic metaphysical boundary between “pathological” and “non-pathological.”

There are only recurring dynamic configurations under constraint.

In practice:

“X pattern of dynamics” is what we tend to call “Y pathology.”

Pathology is a socially and clinically stabilized label for recurring high-risk regimes.

However, mental pathologies vary in how they assert themselves.

## 7.1 Interface-Dominant Pathologies

These assert primarily through interaction:

- Social dysfunction  
- Occupational impairment  
- Relational conflict  
- Self-identified distress  

They may remain unrecognized if:

- The environment tolerates them  
- The individual does not experience them as distressing  
- The pattern is socially reinforced  

These are context-sensitive and locality-dependent.

---

## 7.2 Enforcement-Dominant Pathologies

These assert through biological destabilization.

They produce breakdown independent of social tolerance.

Examples include:

- Acute psychosis with disorganization  
- Delirium  
- Severe bipolar mania with sleep collapse  
- Catatonia  
- Advanced substance withdrawal  
- Neurodegenerative decline  

These resemble physiological diseases in that they:

- Escalate through biological enforcement  
- Disrupt core regulatory systems  
- Persist regardless of moral framing  

They behave more like cancer than personality conflict.

---

## 7.3 Gradient Continuum

Interface-dominant patterns can become enforcement-dominant.

For example:

- Chronic anxiety → sleep deprivation → hormonal dysregulation  
- Addiction → neuroadaptation → withdrawal instability  
- Mania → sustained sleep loss → psychotic break  

Psychological patterns may begin relationally expressed and become biologically self-reinforcing.

There is no binary boundary.

There is only escalation across enforcement thresholds.

---

# 8. Overload and Failure

Overload occurs when:

Rate of demand > Available capacity

Forms include:

- Emotional overload  
- Cognitive overload  
- Sensory overload  
- Social overload  

Enforcement signals include:

- Distress  
- Fatigue  
- Withdrawal  
- Numbing  
- Agitation  

These indicate constraint conflict, not moral defect.

---

# 9. The Stability of the Sink

Maladaptive patterns persist because they function.

A “pathological” pattern often:

- Absorbs excess energy  
- Reduces uncertainty  
- Provides closure  
- Becomes deeply habituated  

Examples:

- Addiction  
- Compulsion  
- Ideological fixation  
- Identity hardening  
- Self-harm loops  

These stabilize locally while increasing long-term fragility.

---

# 10. Recovery as Re-Routing

Recovery is not normalization.

It is:

- Re-routing energy into a more viable sink  
- Lowering transformation cost  
- Expanding elasticity  
- Restoring recovery bandwidth  

Suppression without replacement increases instability.

Recovery is:

- Nonlinear  
- Rate-limited  
- Probabilistic  

---

# 11. Elasticity as Functional Health

Health is not neutrality.

Health is:

- Gradient flexibility  
- Regime shift capacity  
- Re-expansion after contraction  
- Multi-capacity balance  

Temporary rigidity is adaptive.

Persistent loss of re-expansion capacity increases collapse risk.

---

# 12. Embeddedness

No mind is isolated.

The system is embedded within:

- Family structures  
- Economies  
- Media ecosystems  
- Governance systems  
- Cultural salience fields  

Individual distress may reflect systemic overload.

Intervention must consider locality, not only internal routing.

---

# 13. Diagnostic Practice Boundary

This framework:

- Models dynamic regimes  
- Traces energy flow  
- Identifies collapse risk  

It does not replace clinical judgment.

Intervention thresholds remain:

- Practitioner-determined  
- Context-dependent  
- Risk-sensitive  

Disagreement should be resolved through:

- Structural tracing  
- Gradient analysis  
- Elasticity assessment  
- Locality examination

# 14. Expansions
- **[Constraint-Aware Psychology Allowance Hypothesis and Conversion Mapping](constraint-aware-psychology-allowance-hypothesis.md)**

---

# 15. Provisional Status

This is a working compression.

If consistent mismatch appears between:

- Predicted energy routing  
- Observed stabilization  
- Lived experience  

The framework must be revised or discarded.

No model is exempt from constraint.

Reality tracing applies here as well.
