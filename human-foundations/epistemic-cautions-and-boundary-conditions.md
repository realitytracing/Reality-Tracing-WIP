## Epistemic Cautions and Boundary Conditions

This framework operates between two symmetric failure modes: false totalization and false equivalence.

The following distinctions are non-negotiable.

### Stability ≠ Completeness
Stability of understanding does not imply complete understanding of reality.

A model may remain functional, predictive, and usable under pressure without being exhaustive or final. Stability indicates survivability under constraint, not access to total truth.

Mistaking stability for completeness produces scientism and epistemic overreach.

### Incompleteness ≠ Total Relativity of Understanding
The incompleteness of understanding does not imply that all understandings are equally valid.

Models differ in cost, predictive power, failure behavior, and alignment with constraint. Incomplete knowledge can still be meaningfully ranked by how well it preserves viability.

Denying these distinctions collapses into anti-intellectualism.

### Progress ≠ Eventual Completeness
Progress in understanding does not imply that all unknowns will eventually be discovered.

Some aspects of reality may be undecidable, unmeasurable, unenumerable or inaccessible in principle due to irreversibility, rate limits, or observer constraints.

Progress consists in reducing catastrophic error, tightening bounds, and improving failure localization under constraint—not guaranteeing total knowledge.

### Unenumerability and the Limits of Progress

Some limits to understanding do not arise from lack of data, computation, or formal rigor, but from **unenumerability**.

Unenumerability refers to situations where the space of relevant variables, distinctions, or questions cannot be fully listed in advance. In such cases, the hypothesis space itself is open-ended. New categories, meanings, or failure modes may emerge only through interaction, pressure, or historical development.

This is distinct from undecidability. Undecidable problems can often be stated precisely even if they cannot be resolved algorithmically. Unenumerable domains resist even complete specification of the question space.

Human systems are frequently unenumerable:
- Salience objects can emerge unexpectedly
- New local ends can become viable or collapse
- Meanings and values can reorganize under pressure
- Novel coordination and failure modes can appear

Because of unenumerability, progress in understanding cannot converge to total knowledge. There is no final list of unknowns to exhaust.

Progress consists instead in:
- Reducing catastrophic error
- Improving adaptation under uncertainty
- Preserving flexibility in the face of novelty
- Maintaining contact with constraint as categories shift

Unenumerability is therefore not a temporary limitation. It is a structural feature of emergent systems.

### Unknowability ≠ Irrelevance
The existence of unknowable variables does not make stable understanding optional or meaningless.

Finite agents must act under uncertainty. Under such conditions, probabilistically disciplined, constraint-aware models reliably outperform unconstrained belief.

Stability matters precisely because cognition is limited.

These distinctions preserve realism without collapse into either dogma or nihilism.

Reality tracing depends on them.
