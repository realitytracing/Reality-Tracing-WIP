# Salience

## Energy Must Flow Somewhere

Energy must go somewhere.

In living systems, unused energy does not remain neutral. It produces pressure. Salience is the mechanism by which finite energy is routed, stabilized, and dissipated over time. It does not act by intention or choice. It emerges as a regulatory process that creates **ends** for energy to sink into.

Salience is therefore not preference, motivation, or value in isolation. It is **energy stabilization under constraint**.

## Salience as Directional Flow

Anything that enters the mind can become an idea.  
Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea.  
Sets of ideas can be operationalized into movement, habits, and local ends.

Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through the allocation of finite energy over time.

Salience determines:
- What receives attention  
- What is repeated  
- What is resisted  
- What is allowed to fade  

It operates continuously and automatically. Conscious reflection can influence salience, but does not suspend it.

## Habituation and Stabilization

As salient patterns persist, they are reinforced through **habituation**.

Habituation reduces the energetic cost of repeatedly traversed paths. When habituated paths align with salient local ends, the system experiences this alignment as:
- Reward  
- Relief  
- Restoration  

When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system produces corrective signals such as:
- Pain  
- Fatigue  
- Distress  
- Agitation  

These signals are not moral judgments. They are **efficiency feedback**, indicating misalignment between energy allocation, habituated structure, and continued viability.

## Salience Instability Under Excess Energy

Salience is not shaped only by scarcity. It is also shaped by **energy surplus**.

Because energy must always flow somewhere, salience requires local ends that can absorb energy at a sufficient rate to remain stable. When available energy per unit time exceeds the absorption capacity of existing salient paths, salience destabilizes.

This instability does not require deprivation, dissatisfaction, or conflict. It can arise when:
- Salient paths are highly frictionless  
- Local ends are reached too quickly  
- Sustained engagement requires little effort  
- Habituation fails to establish durable cost structures  

In these conditions, local ends cease to function as stabilizers. They do not hold salience long enough to regulate energy. Salience therefore reallocates, searching for new ends capable of sustaining energy flow.

## Observable Effects of Excess-Energy Instability

When salience destabilizes under excess energy, common manifestations include:
- Restlessness without a clear object  
- Rapid cycling of interests, identities, or commitments  
- Escalation of novelty-seeking or stimulation  
- Difficulty resting despite adequate resources  
- Chronic agitation in the absence of threat  

This pattern is often misinterpreted as boredom, pathology, or moral failure.

It is none of these.

It is a **rate mismatch** between energy availability and the stabilizing capacity of existing salient paths.

## Summary

Salience is the system by which finite energy is:
- Directed  
- Stabilized  
- Habituated  
- Dissipated  

Both scarcity and surplus can destabilize salience when local ends fail to regulate energy flow.

Salience does not seek meaning or virtue.  
It seeks **viability under constraint**.

Energy must go somewhere.
