# Salience

Anything that enters the mind or exist in it, can become an idea. Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea. Sets of ideas can be operationalized into movement, habits, and local ends. Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through the allocation of finite energy over time.

As salient patterns stabilize, they are reinforced through habituation. When habits align with salient local ends, this alignment is experienced as reward and restoration. When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system experiences pain, fatigue, or distress as corrective signals. These signals are not moral judgments but efficiency feedback, indicating misalignment between energy use, habit, and continued viability.

## Salience Instability Under Excess Energy

Salience is not only shaped by scarcity. It is also shaped by **energy surplus**.

Because energy must always flow somewhere, salience requires local ends that can absorb energy at a sufficient rate to remain stable. When available energy per unit time exceeds the absorption capacity of existing salient paths, salience becomes unstable.

This instability does not require deprivation, dissatisfaction, or conflict. It can arise when:
- Salient paths are too frictionless
- Local ends are reached too quickly
- Effort required to sustain engagement is too low
- Habituation fails to establish durable cost structures

In such conditions, local ends no longer perform their stabilizing function. They do not “hold” salience long enough to regulate energy. Salience therefore reallocates, seeking new ends capable of sustaining energy flow.

This manifests as:
- Restlessness without clear cause
- Rapid cycling of interests, identities, or commitments
- Escalation of novelty-seeking
- Difficulty resting despite adequate resources
- Chronic agitation in the absence of threat

This is not boredom, pathology, or moral weakness. It is a **rate mismatch** between energy availability and salience stabilization capacity.
