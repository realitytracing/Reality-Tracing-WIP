## Virtual Energy and Salience(Tractability Clarification)

For the purposes of tractability, the terms energy, salience, and salience structure in this body of work are virtual modeling constructs.

They are not claims about a literal conserved substance, nor are they metaphysical primitives.

Energy refers to bounded transformation capacity — the finite ability of a system (biological, cognitive, or social) to change state over time. It is a bookkeeping abstraction used to track how much transformation a system can sustain under constraint.

The “conservation” implied here is structural rather than physical: transformation capacity is always limited, always routed, and always paid for in some form (metabolic cost, attention, coordination load, opportunity cost, etc.), even as it changes substrate across layers.

Salience refers to the routing and weighting mechanism that directs this bounded transformation capacity toward particular paths rather than allowing it to diffuse across all possible alternatives.

Without salience, transformation would distribute across too many competing possibilities for coherent action, stabilization, or persistence to occur. Salience constrains combinatorial branching by selectively reinforcing certain trajectories and suppressing others.

Salience and energy are therefore virtual tools for modeling:

Bounded capacity
Directed transformation
Stabilization under constraint
Prevention of combinatorial explosion

They do not posit a hidden ontology.

They provide a disciplined way to trace how finite systems persist without dissolving into randomness.

## Energy Must Flow Somewhere

Energy must go somewhere.

In living systems, unused capacity does not remain neutral. It accumulates pressure.  
Salience is the regulatory process by which finite capacity is routed, stabilized, and dissipated over time.

Salience does not act by intention or choice.  
It emerges as a constraint-bound allocation process that creates **ends** into which capacity can sink.

Salience is therefore not preference, motivation, or value in isolation.  
It is **capacity stabilization under constraint**.

Energy is a primary capacity, but not the only one salience routes.

## Salience as Directional Flow

Anything that enters the mind can become an idea.  
Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea.  
Sets of ideas can be operationalized into thoughts, movements, habits, and local ends.

Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through allocation of finite capacity over time.

Salience determines:
- What receives attention  
- What is repeated  
- What is resisted  
- What is allowed to fade  

It operates continuously and automatically.  
Conscious reflection can influence salience, but does not suspend it.

---

## Capacity Is Multi-Dimensional

Salience does not operate over a single scalar resource.

Human systems contain multiple bounded capacities, including but not limited to:

- Metabolic energy  
- Cognitive focus  
- Attention  
- Emotional bandwidth  
- Working memory  
- Time  
- Physical recovery capacity  

Salience stabilizes whenever **a dominant capacity is sufficiently occupied to absorb direction**, even if other capacities remain underutilized or are being silently depleted.

A system can therefore feel stable, engaged, and coherent while drifting toward delayed failure in a backgrounded capacity.

Salience answers:

> “What can absorb capacity now?”

Not:

> “What preserves long-term viability across all dimensions?”

---

## Habituation and Stabilization

As salient patterns persist, they are reinforced through **habituation**.

Habituation reduces the cost—energetic, cognitive, emotional—of repeatedly traversed paths.

When habituated paths align with viable local ends, the system experiences this alignment as:

- Reward  
- Relief  
- Restoration  

When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system produces corrective signals such as:

- Pain  
- Fatigue  
- Distress  
- Agitation  

These signals are not moral judgments.  
They are **efficiency feedback**, indicating misalignment between capacity allocation, habituated structure, and continued viability.

---

## Salience Without Global Optimization

Salience does not require optimal depletion of all capacities.

A local end may dominate salience by fully occupying one capacity—such as cognitive abstraction—even while metabolic exhaustion or recovery debt remains backgrounded.

In such cases:

- Direction remains stable  
- Competing local ends are suppressed  
- Future-facing constraints (sleep, health, reversibility) may remain non-salient  

This explains sustained periods of intense engagement—intellectual, emotional, ideological—without immediate collapse.

Delayed enforcement is still possible.

## Salience Instability Under Excess Capacity

Salience is shaped not only by scarcity, but also by **capacity surplus**.

Because capacity must be routed, salience requires local ends capable of absorbing it at sufficient rate.

When available capacity per unit time exceeds the absorption capacity of existing salient paths, instability emerges.

This does not require deprivation or conflict.  
It can arise when:

- Salient paths are frictionless  
- Local ends are reached too quickly  
- Sustained engagement requires little effort  
- Habituation fails to generate durable structure  

In these conditions, local ends cease to stabilize.  
Salience reallocates in search of new sinks.

---

## Observable Effects of Excess-Capacity Instability

Common manifestations include:

- Restlessness without clear object  
- Rapid cycling of interests or identities  
- Escalation of novelty-seeking  
- Difficulty resting despite adequate resources  
- Agitation without external threat  

This is often misinterpreted as boredom, pathology, or moral failure.

It is a **rate mismatch** between available capacity and stabilizing absorption.

## Ideas as Local Ends

Local ends are not limited to physical outcomes.

**Ideas themselves can function as local ends.**

Examples:

- Thinking and idea exploration  
- Understanding reality  
- Optimization  
- Capacity tracking  
- Self-analysis  
- Balance as abstraction  

When an idea continuously absorbs attention and cognition, it can dominate salience as effectively as physical activity.

In such cases:

- Salience stabilizes within the mental domain  
- Movement, sociality, and rest may background  
- Future constraints may remain non-salient  

This is not pathology.  
It is salience operating normally under constraint.

---

## Balance as a Local End

Balance can function as:

- A stabilizing abstraction  
- A coordination heuristic  
- An indirect regulator of multiple capacities  

However, like all local ends, balance can be totalized or distorted.

When moralized or rigidified, it can increase instability rather than reduce it.

Salience does not seek balance as an ideal.  
It seeks **viability**.

---

## Salience Collapse Under Loss of Local Ends

A severe failure mode occurs when highly salient local ends are destroyed or rendered unreachable.

Salience can lose its primary routing structure.

This registers as:

- Grief  
- Disorientation  
- Aimlessness  
- Collapse of motivation  

Capacity remains available.  
Paths no longer lead to viable completion.

This is structural rupture, not weakness.

---

## Loss as Devaluation of Idea Viability

Loss can invalidate not only a local end, but the surrounding idea-cluster.

Salience may reclassify related ideas as:

- Too costly  
- Too fragile  
- Unsafe  
- Likely to reproduce destabilization  

Ideas may remain cognitively accessible while no longer attracting salience.

This is **protective reweighting**, not denial.

---

## Totalized Local Ends and Future-Space Collapse

Some local ends function as primary organizers of:

- Meaning  
- Identity  
- Time horizon  
- Subordinate goals  
- Future imagination  

When such a totalized end collapses, salience may lose access not only to present stabilizers, but to **imagined futures**.

This registers as:

- Loss of future orientation  
- Inability to imagine viable next states  
- A sense that “there is no future”  

This is **future-space collapse**, not indecision.

---

## Recovery as Salience Re-Routing

Recovery is not external to salience dynamics.  
It is a stabilization outcome following redirection.

When a new path absorbs even minimal capacity without immediate failure, reinforcement begins.

Recovery is:

- Iterative  
- Energy-regulatory  
- Non-moral  
- Often gradual  

Over time, recovery itself can habituate and become a default maneuver.

---

## Structural Summary

Salience is the bounded routing of finite capacity.

It:

- Directs  
- Stabilizes  
- Reinforces  
- Dissipates  

It destabilizes under:

- Excess capacity  
- Loss of local ends  
- Loss of idea viability  
- Collapse of totalized ends  

It re-stabilizes through:

- Iterative redirection  
- Discovery of new local ends  
- Habituation of viable paths  

Salience does not seek meaning, virtue, or optimization.

It seeks **viability under constraint**.

Capacity must flow.
