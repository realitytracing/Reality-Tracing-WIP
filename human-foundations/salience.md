## Energy Must Flow Somewhere

Energy must go somewhere.

In living systems, unused energy does not remain neutral. It produces pressure. Salience is the mechanism by which finite energy is routed, stabilized, and dissipated over time. It does not act by intention or choice. It emerges as a regulatory process that creates **ends** for energy to sink into.

Salience is therefore not preference, motivation, or value in isolation.  
It is **capacity stabilization under constraint**.

While energy is a primary capacity, it is not the only one salience routes.

---

## Salience as Directional Flow

Anything that enters the mind can become an idea.  
Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea.  
Sets of ideas can be operationalized into, thoughts, movement, habits, and local ends.

Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through the allocation of finite capacity over time.

Salience determines:
- What receives attention  
- What is repeated  
- What is resisted  
- What is allowed to fade  

It operates continuously and automatically. Conscious reflection can influence salience, but does not suspend it.

---

## Capacity Is Multi-Dimensional

Salience does not operate over a single scalar resource.

Human systems contain multiple bounded capacities, including but not limited to:
- Metabolic energy  
- Cognitive focus  
- Attention  
- Emotional bandwidth  
- Working memory  
- Time  
- Physical recovery capacity  

Salience stabilizes whenever **any dominant capacity is sufficiently occupied to absorb direction**, even if other capacities remain underutilized or are being silently depleted.

A system can therefore feel stable, engaged, and coherent while drifting toward delayed failure in a backgrounded capacity.

Salience answers:
> “What can absorb capacity *now*?”

Not:
> “What preserves long-term viability across all dimensions?”

---

## Habituation and Stabilization

As salient patterns persist, they are reinforced through **habituation**.

Habituation reduces the cost—energetic, cognitive, emotional—of repeatedly traversed paths. When habituated paths align with salient local ends, the system experiences this alignment as:
- Reward  
- Relief  
- Restoration  

When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system produces corrective signals such as:
- Pain  
- Fatigue  
- Distress  
- Agitation  

These signals are not moral judgments. They are **efficiency feedback**, indicating misalignment between capacity allocation, habituated structure, and continued viability.

---

## Salience Without Energy Depletion

Salience does not require optimal depletion of all capacities.

A local end may dominate salience by fully occupying one capacity—such as cognitive focus or abstraction—even when metabolic exhaustion, physical fatigue, or recovery debt has not yet enforced reweighting.

In such cases:
- Direction remains stable  
- Competing local ends are backgrounded  
- Future-facing constraints (sleep, health, reversibility) may remain non-salient  

This explains why systems can sustain long periods of intense engagement—intellectual, emotional, or ideological—without immediate collapse, until delayed enforcement occurs.

## Salience Instability Under Excess Energy

Salience is not shaped only by scarcity. It is also shaped by **capacity surplus**.

Because capacity must always be routed, salience requires local ends that can absorb it at a sufficient rate to remain stable. When available capacity per unit time exceeds the absorption capacity of existing salient paths, salience destabilizes.

This instability does not require deprivation, dissatisfaction, or conflict. It can arise when:
- Salient paths are highly frictionless  
- Local ends are reached too quickly  
- Sustained engagement requires little effort  
- Habituation fails to establish durable cost structures  

In these conditions, local ends cease to function as stabilizers. Salience reallocates, searching for new ends capable of sustaining flow.

---

## Observable Effects of Excess-Capacity Instability

When salience destabilizes under excess capacity, common manifestations include:
- Restlessness without a clear object  
- Rapid cycling of interests, identities, or commitments  
- Escalation of novelty-seeking or stimulation  
- Difficulty resting despite adequate resources  
- Chronic agitation in the absence of threat  

This pattern is often misinterpreted as boredom, pathology, or moral failure.

It is none of these.

It is a **rate mismatch** between available capacity and the stabilizing power of existing local ends.

---

## Ideas as Local Ends

Local ends are not limited to external actions or outcomes.

**Ideas themselves can function as local ends.**

Examples include:
- Thinking and idea exploration  
- Understanding reality  
- Optimizing energy use  
- Maintaining balance  
- Managing or expanding capacity  
- Even tracking salience or energy itself  

When an idea can continuously absorb attention, cognition, and focus, it can dominate salience as effectively as any physical activity.

In such cases:
- Salience may stabilize entirely within the mental domain  
- Other local ends (movement, sociality, rest) may be backgrounded  
- Future-facing constraints may remain non-salient  

This is not denial or pathology.  
It is **salience functioning normally under constraint**.

---

## Balance as a Local End

The idea of balance can itself become a local end.

Balance may function as:
- A stabilizing abstraction  
- A coordination heuristic  
- A way of regulating multiple capacities indirectly  

However, like all local ends, balance is subject to habituation and distortion. When treated as a totalized or moralized demand rather than a flexible regulator, it can paradoxically increase instability.

Salience does not seek balance as an ideal.  
It seeks **viability**.

---

## Salience Collapse Under Loss of Local Ends

A distinct and more severe failure mode occurs when **highly salient local ends are lost, destroyed, or rendered unreachable**.

When this happens, salience does not merely destabilize — it can **lose its primary routing structure**.

The severing of salient paths registers as:
- Pain  
- Grief  
- Loss  
- Aimlessness  
- Disorientation  

Energy and capacity continue to be available, but established paths no longer lead to viable completion. Salience is forced to redirect without adequate stabilizers.

This condition is volatile.

---

## Loss as Devaluation of Idea Viability

Loss does not only remove a local end.  
It can also **invalidate the viability of the ideas associated with that end**.

When a highly salient local end collapses, salience may reclassify the surrounding idea-cluster as:
- Too costly  
- Too fragile  
- Unsafe  
- Likely to reproduce destabilizing pain  

Ideas may remain cognitively accessible while no longer attracting salience.

This is **protective reweighting**, not rejection.

---

## Totalized Local Ends and Collapse of Futures

Some local ends are not merely salient.  
They are **totalized**.

A totalized local end functions as a primary organizer of:
- Meaning  
- Identity  
- Time horizon  
- Future imagination  
- Subordinate local ends  

When such a totalized local end collapses, salience may lose access not only to present stabilizers, but to **imagined futures themselves**.

This registers as:
- Loss of future orientation  
- Inability to imagine viable next states  
- A sense that “there is no future”  

This is **future-space collapse**, not indecision or belief.

---

## Recovery as Salience Re-Routing

Recovery is not external to salience dynamics.  
It is **one possible stabilization outcome** when salience fails, redirects, and tests new paths.

Recovery is an energy- and capacity-regulation process, not a moral achievement.

When a new path absorbs even minimal capacity without immediate failure, it becomes reinforced.

Over time, recovery itself may habituate and become a **default maneuver** rather than an exception.

---

## Summary

Salience is the system by which bounded capacity is:
- Directed  
- Stabilized  
- Habituated  
- Dissipated  

Salience can destabilize due to:
- **Excess capacity** (insufficient absorption)  
- **Loss of local ends** (path severance)  
- **Loss of idea viability** (protective withdrawal)  
- **Collapse of totalized ends** (loss of future structure)  

Salience can also **re-stabilize** through:
- Iterative redirection  
- Discovery of new local ends  
- Habituation of recovery itself  

Salience does not seek meaning, virtue, balance, or health.

It seeks **viability under constraint**.

Capacity must go somewhere.
