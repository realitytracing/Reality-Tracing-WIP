# Salience

## Energy Must Flow Somewhere

Energy must go somewhere.

In living systems, unused energy does not remain neutral. It produces pressure. Salience is the mechanism by which finite energy is routed, stabilized, and dissipated over time. It does not act by intention or choice. It emerges as a regulatory process that creates **ends** for energy to sink into.

Salience is therefore not preference, motivation, or value in isolation.  
It is **energy stabilization under constraint**.

## Salience as Directional Flow

Anything that enters the mind can become an idea.  
Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea.  
Sets of ideas can be operationalized into movement, habits, and local ends.

Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through the allocation of finite energy over time.

Salience determines:
- What receives attention  
- What is repeated  
- What is resisted  
- What is allowed to fade  

It operates continuously and automatically. Conscious reflection can influence salience, but does not suspend it.

---

## Habituation and Stabilization

As salient patterns persist, they are reinforced through **habituation**.

Habituation reduces the energetic cost of repeatedly traversed paths. When habituated paths align with salient local ends, the system experiences this alignment as:
- Reward  
- Relief  
- Restoration  

When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system produces corrective signals such as:
- Pain  
- Fatigue  
- Distress  
- Agitation  

These signals are not moral judgments. They are **efficiency feedback**, indicating misalignment between energy allocation, habituated structure, and continued viability.

## Salience Instability Under Excess Energy

Salience is not shaped only by scarcity. It is also shaped by **energy surplus**.

Because energy must always flow somewhere, salience requires local ends that can absorb energy at a sufficient rate to remain stable. When available energy per unit time exceeds the absorption capacity of existing salient paths, salience destabilizes.

This instability does not require deprivation, dissatisfaction, or conflict. It can arise when:
- Salient paths are highly frictionless  
- Local ends are reached too quickly  
- Sustained engagement requires little effort  
- Habituation fails to establish durable cost structures  

In these conditions, local ends cease to function as stabilizers. They do not hold salience long enough to regulate energy. Salience therefore reallocates, searching for new ends capable of sustaining energy flow.

## Observable Effects of Excess-Energy Instability

When salience destabilizes under excess energy, common manifestations include:
- Restlessness without a clear object  
- Rapid cycling of interests, identities, or commitments  
- Escalation of novelty-seeking or stimulation  
- Difficulty resting despite adequate resources  
- Chronic agitation in the absence of threat  

This pattern is often misinterpreted as boredom, pathology, or moral failure.

It is none of these.

It is a **rate mismatch** between energy availability and the stabilizing capacity of existing salient paths.

---

## Salience Collapse Under Loss of Local Ends

A distinct and more severe failure mode occurs when **highly salient local ends are lost, destroyed, or rendered unreachable**.

When this happens, salience does not merely destabilize — it can **lose its primary routing structure**.

The severing of salient paths registers as:
- Pain  
- Grief  
- Loss  
- Aimlessness  
- Disorientation  

Energy continues to flow, but the established paths no longer lead to viable completion. Salience is forced to redirect without adequate stabilizers.

This condition is volatile.

## Loss as Devaluation of Idea Viability

Loss does not only remove a local end.  
It can also **invalidate the viability of the ideas associated with that end**.

When a highly salient local end collapses, salience may reclassify the surrounding idea-cluster as:
- Too costly  
- Too fragile  
- Unsafe  
- Likely to reproduce destabilizing pain  

In this case, the loss propagates *backward* through the salience network.

Ideas that previously organized energy may remain cognitively accessible, but no longer attract salience. They persist as background content rather than stabilizing ends.

This explains why, after loss (e.g., a breakup), individuals may avoid re-engaging with entire categories of meaning for a period of time—not due to indecision or denial, but because salience no longer treats those ideas as viable regulators of energy.

This is **protective reweighting**, not rejection.

---

## Energy Redirection After Path Severance

When salient paths can no longer reach local ends—and associated idea structures are devalued—energy is often redirected into alternative sinks.

These redirections are not exhaustive, inevitable, or morally uniform. They are **structural attempts to discharge energy under constraint** when stabilizing ends are unavailable.

Observed redirection patterns may include:
- Radicalization  
- Severe withdrawal or apathy  
- Depressive collapse  
- Self-directed harm  
- Intentional deprivation or starvation  
- Risk escalation  

These outcomes are not chosen for their content. They persist because they:
- Absorb energy  
- Provide intensity when orientation is lost  
- Create temporary structure in the absence of viable ends  

This is not preference. It is **regulatory failure under loss**.

---

## Structural Clarification

The appearance of these patterns does not imply:
- Moral weakness  
- Pathology as primary cause  
- Ideological commitment  
- Rational endorsement  

They indicate that:
- Energy remains present  
- Salience remains active  
- Stabilizing local ends and idea-clusters are unavailable  

The system is attempting to remain dynamically viable under extreme constraint.

---

## Summary

Salience is the system by which finite energy is:
- Directed  
- Stabilized  
- Habituated  
- Dissipated  

Salience can destabilize due to:
- **Excess energy** (insufficient absorption)  
- **Loss of local ends** (path severance)  
- **Loss of idea viability** (protective withdrawal from destabilizing domains)  

Each produces volatility through a distinct mechanism.

Salience does not seek meaning, virtue, or health.  
It seeks **viability under constraint**.

Energy must go somewhere.
