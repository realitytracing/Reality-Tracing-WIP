# Interactional Epistemics

## Permeability, Constraint, and Abstraction in Scientific and Philosophical Modeling

---

## Abstract

All inquiry operates within abstraction.

Perception, action, memory, mathematics, language, scientific modeling, and philosophical reasoning are compressions of signal under constraint. Objects, causes, categories, and laws are stabilized partitions within combinatorial structure, selected for tractability, coordination, and predictive utility.

Scientific and philosophical models are therefore not mirrors of reality but structured compressions interacting with empirical constraint.

This document proposes a generalized framework:

> A model is epistemically legitimate to the degree that it remains permeable to interaction beyond its explicit scope, responsive to constraint signals, and revisable under boundary stress.

Interactional Epistemics reframes knowledge not as progressive closure toward final enumeration, but as adaptive stabilization under constraint within combinatorial partition space.

# 1. Experience as Signal and Abstraction

## 1.1 Signals

Experience begins as signal:

- Sensory gradients
- Affective shifts
- Proprioceptive tension
- Intuitive pulls
- Memory traces

Signals are already filtered and rate-limited. There is no unmediated access to reality.

## 1.2 Abstraction

Abstraction binds signal into stable units:

- “Fish”
- “Object”
- “Cause”
- “Justice”
- “Electron”

These units are tractable compressions, not ontological guarantees.

A fish purchased at a market is not accessed as a complete microphysical state. It is treated as a stable statistical distribution across time that is pragmatically partitioned and labeled for coordination.

Abstraction makes interaction possible. It is necessarily lossy.

## 1.3 Memory as Imperfect Stabilization

Memory stores compressed reconstructions, not raw signal.

Belief becomes:

> Stabilized abstraction across time under constraint.

Epistemics is therefore the management of abstraction under signal pressure.

---

# 2. Philosophy and Science as Compression Practices

Philosophy and empirical science differ in method but share structure:

- Both partition experience.
- Both stabilize invariants.
- Both compress signal.
- Both operate under combinatorial constraint.

Scientific modeling formalizes partitions mathematically.
Philosophy formalizes partitions conceptually.

Neither escapes abstraction.

The distinction lies in validation regimes, not ontological access.

---

# 3. The Combinatorial Structure of Modeling

## 3.1 Partition Space

Modeling requires:

- Selecting variables
- Defining objects
- Choosing invariances
- Discarding residual structure

For sufficiently complex systems, possible partitions grow combinatorially.

Multiple inequivalent models may fit the same finite dataset.

Underdetermination is structural, not accidental.

## 3.2 Objecthood as Stabilized Interaction

No unique object inventory is directly given by reality.

An apple may be partitioned as:

- Whole object
- Functional parts
- Molecular lattice
- Field excitation region
- Nutritional unit

Partitioning depends on constraint, purpose, and invariance detection.

Objecthood stabilizes under interaction, not metaphysical pre-labeling.

# 4. Strategic vs Ontological Closure

## 4.1 Strategic Closure

Strategic closure is necessary:

- Scope is declared.
- Simplifications are explicit.
- Boundaries are operational.

Example: Newtonian mechanics at low velocities.

## 4.2 Ontological Closure

Ontological closure occurs when:

- Model boundaries are treated as features of reality.
- Excluded variables are treated as nonexistent.
- Operational success is mistaken for exhaustiveness.

The model artifact is not dogmatic.

Dogma arises in its administration.

---

# 5. The Interactional Permeability Principle

A claim to reality based on a model is epistemically legitimate only if:

1. Scope limitations are explicitly declared.
2. Excluded variables are treated as unscoped, not nonexistent.
3. The model remains revisable under boundary stress.
4. Hypothesis space is not treated as exhaustively enumerated.
5. Persistent mismatch is treated as structural signal.

Permeability is not humility rhetoric.
It is structural necessity under combinatorial constraint.

---

# 6. Infinity as Boundary Stress Signal

Infinity appears easily in abstraction.

Formal systems allow:

- Iteration without cost
- Recursion without dissipation
- Growth without enforcement

Empirical systems do not.

When a model predicts:

- Infinite growth
- Infinite precision
- Infinite regress
- Unbounded optimization

within finite-energy, time-bound systems, this signals possible boundary mismatch.

Infinity is not automatically false.

It is a stress test.

---

## 6.1 Diagnostic Cascade

When unbounded output appears:

1. Check computational instability.
2. Check parameter mis-specification.
3. Check algebraic error.
4. Check category mistake.
5. Check proxy literalization.
6. Check partition error.
7. Check conceptual lumping.
8. Check extrapolation beyond validated range.
9. Check regime transition omission.
10. Check for omitted constraint.

Only after earlier branches are excluded does inference to missing clamp strengthen.

---

# 7. Constraint as Epistemic Grounding

Interactional Epistemics generalizes beyond belief negotiation.

It grounds epistemics in constraint.

A model is not tested against pure logic alone, but against:

- Rate limits
- Energy limits
- Irreversibility
- Cross-domain coherence
- Persistent signal mismatch

Constraint provides the non-negotiable anchor.

Nothing is fake.

Only attempted conversions of abstraction into reality that reality does not permit are false.

---

# 8. Interactional Epistemics Generalized

Original interactional epistemics concerned belief interaction across agents.

Generalized interactional epistemics concerns:

> Interaction between abstraction and constraint.

This includes:

- Scientific models interacting with empirical boundary
- Philosophical systems interacting with lived experience
- Mathematical formalisms interacting with physical instantiation
- Personal belief interacting with embodied signal

All epistemics occurs within abstraction.

But abstraction is not sovereign.

Constraint enforces.

---

# 9. The Click Phenomenon

When abstraction integrates signal across domains without persistent contradiction, a local stabilization occurs.

This is experienced as:

- Reduced friction
- Coherence across values
- Decreased internal contradiction

The “click” is not mystical.

It is cross-domain compression alignment under constraint.

If friction persists, the abstraction remains misaligned.

---

# 10. Scientific Progress Reframed

Scientific progress becomes:

- Iterative partition refinement
- Boundary detection
- Regime transition mapping
- Constraint integration

It is not final enumeration.

It is adaptive stabilization.

Robust models:

- Survive scope expansion
- Integrate anomaly
- Remain bounded under extrapolation
- Cross-domain cohere

---

# 11. Explanatory vs Engineering Modeling

Engineering modeling:

- Restricts scope
- Enforces declared boundaries
- Uses safety margins

Explanatory modeling:

- Expands scope
- Integrates across partitions
- Requires permeability

Engineering closure is legitimate.

Explanatory ontological closure is not.

---

# 12. Recursive Application

Interactional Epistemics is itself a model.

Its legitimacy depends on:

- Remaining permeable
- Accepting constraint signals
- Avoiding totalizing claims

If treated as final enumeration, it violates its own principle.

---

# 13. Conclusion

All knowledge operates within abstraction.

All abstraction is compression.

Compression space is combinatorial.

Finite agents cannot guarantee exhaustiveness.

Constraint enforces boundary.

Epistemic legitimacy does not require omniscience.

It requires permeability under constraint.

Interactional Epistemics replaces final closure with disciplined openness, not relativism.

It affirms:

- Structured reality
- Constraint-grounded stabilization
- Scale-relative validity
- Adaptive refinement

The only failure is treating abstraction as sovereign over enforcement.
