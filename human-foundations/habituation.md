# Habituation

Habituation is the process by which repeated patterns of attention, action, and response reduce energy cost and increase efficiency over time.

Through habituation:
- Frequently activated pathways become easier to access
- Successful cycles stabilize
- Cognitive and emotional load decreases
- Variance narrows

Habituation applies not only to ideas and behaviors, but to cognitive pathways themselves. Intuition, reasoning, emotion, memory, and sensory processing can all become weighted through repeated use.

Habituation is not inherently good or bad. It is a neutral efficiency mechanism. It enables skill, care, focus, specialization, and continuity. It also creates blind spots and rigidity when contexts shift.

When a habituated cycle becomes energetically non-viable, negative feedback appears as fatigue, distress, confusion, or overload. This signals the need for reweighting rather than moral failure.

Habituation stabilizes salience temporarily. All stability remains relative and revisable under changing constraints.
