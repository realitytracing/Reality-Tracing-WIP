# Local Ends

## Definition

Local ends are the **bounded targets toward which human energy flows**.

In human systems, attention, effort, emotion, and time do not remain static. Energy must always flow toward something. That “something” is an end.

Human energy does not organize around a single, final, or clearly named objective. Instead, it flows toward many overlapping, abstract, partially formed, and shifting ends. These ends are constrained by a single mind’s capacity, by time, and by circumstance.

They are therefore **local**.

“Local” does not mean physically nearby, morally small, conservative, or trivial. It means **bounded within a single human mind and life**.

Everything a human can experience as important, individually, is a subset of possible local ends.

## Why the Term “Local End” Is Used

Using the term *end* alone implies a singular or ultimate goal. This misrepresents how human systems actually operate.

Human energy flows toward:
- Vague states (relief, coherence, dignity)  
- Abstract values (truth, loyalty, power, care)  
- Incomplete ideas or feelings  
- Memories and imagined futures  
- Suppressed desires or forbidden wants  
- Patterns of action rather than explicit goals  

These are not global or final ends. They are constrained by:
- Limited attention  
- Finite energy  
- Time  
- Rate sensitivity  
- Lived context  

They are therefore **local in scope, local in time, and local in energy**.

The term *local end* names this reality precisely:  
energy always flows toward ends, but those ends are provisional, abstract, and mentally localized rather than singular, final, or universal.

## What Counts as a Local End

If a human can care about it, orient toward it, sacrifice for it, explore because of it, suppress it, or suffer without it, then it already qualifies as a local end in this framework.

Local ends include, but are not limited to:
- Needs and wants  
- Values and virtues  
- Moral commitments  
- Curiosity and exploration  
- Sacrifice and duty  
- Care, love, and attachment  
- Power, control, or dominance  
- Identity-stabilizing beliefs  
- Fear-driven avoidance  
- Revenge, resentment, or withdrawal  
- Creativity, play, and expression  

Local ends are not inherently moral, healthy, prosocial, or admirable. They are structurally important because they **organize energy and action under constraint**.

---

## Local Ends Include What Is Suppressed or Disallowed

Local ends are not limited to what people openly pursue or endorse.

They also include what is:
- Suppressed  
- Deferred  
- Moralized against  
- Denied  
- Lived only as longing or fantasy  

Suppression does not remove importance. In many cases, it **stabilizes** it.

Anything that continues to attract attention, emotion, guilt, avoidance, fantasy, or yearning remains a local end, regardless of whether it is permitted, expressed, or acted upon.

Local ends are defined by **ongoing salience and energy allocation**, not by approval, virtue, or permission.

## Local Ends and Livability

Local ends are not final goals, ideals, or utopias.

They are **locally sufficient completions** that make continued life livable under finite energy, attention, and time.

They provide:
- Motivation  
- Restoration  
- Regulation  
- Orientation  
- Reasons for restraint and preservation  

A life does not need to solve history to remain viable. It needs **enough attainable local ends** to prevent collapse.

When local ends are destroyed, blocked, or rendered unattainable, behavior shifts nonlinearly. Fatigue, aggression, despair, and loss of restraint increase as salience searches for new viable trajectories.

---

## Exploration as a Local End

Exploration, curiosity, novelty-seeking, and truth-seeking are not exceptions to local ends. They are common forms of them.

A local end can be the drive to explore, to experiment, to risk disorientation, or to encounter the unknown.

What makes such ends *local* is not their content, but that they are:
- Energetically bounded  
- Lived through a finite mind  
- Pursued without requiring total resolution of reality  

Exploration does not contradict local ends. It **is one**.

---

## Local Ends and Habituation

Habituation is a neutral efficiency mechanism. It does not determine what a person values or pursues.

Habituation reduces the energetic cost of repeatedly traversed paths. It stabilizes salience temporarily.

People habituate:
- How they explore  
- How they care  
- How they resist  
- How they sacrifice  
- How they withdraw  
- How they create  

A habituated path can be:
- Conservative or destabilizing  
- Prosocial or destructive  
- Exploratory or defensive  

Habituation does not preprogram behavior. It only lowers the cost of sustaining a direction **after salience has selected it**.

## Local Ends as Energy Regulators

Local ends do not merely provide meaning or motivation. They function as **energy regulators**.

A viable local end must be capable of absorbing energy at a rate sufficient to stabilize salience. When a local end is too easily satisfied or requires insufficient engagement, it may fail in this role—even if it remains desirable.

In such cases, completion does not restore equilibrium. Salience disengages prematurely and seeks additional ends to maintain energy balance.

This explains why abundance, automation, or frictionless satisfaction can paradoxically increase instability rather than reduce it. Local ends that are too easy **cease to regulate energy effectively**.

---

## Structural Importance (Non-Moral)

Local ends are structurally necessary. They are not moral claims.

They function as redundant stability mechanisms that allow finite agents to:
- Regulate energy  
- Avoid indefinite extraction  
- Recover after strain  
- Preserve option space  

Ignoring local ends does not eliminate them. It drives them underground or forces them into destabilizing forms.

Individual collapse occurs when the **density of attainable local ends** falls below a viable threshold.

---

## Summary

Local ends are the complete space of human-experienced importance, bounded by finite minds operating under constraint.

They are:
- Abstract or concrete  
- Virtuous or destructive  
- Pursued, deferred, or suppressed  
- Stable or exploratory  

They are called *local* because they are limited in scope, time, and energy—not because they are small, trivial, or conservative.

Human life remains livable not by resolving all ends, but by **sustaining enough viable local ends to continue acting under constraint**.
