title: Execution as a Salience and Legitimacy Stressor
*(Artifact — Constraint-Aware Analysis)*

## Status

This document is descriptive, not moral or adjudicative.

It does not argue for or against execution as a policy.  
It traces the **structural effects of execution on salience, legitimacy, and trust** under finite cognition, irreversibility, and uncertainty.

## Irreversibility as a Salience Amplifier

Execution introduces an irreversible state change: death.

Irreversibility is a high-gain salience trigger in human systems. When a human life is permanently removed, salience spikes automatically, regardless of ideology, belief, or personal involvement.

This salience is not optional, reflective, or chosen. It is structural.

---

## The “Why” Reflex

Following an execution, humans exhibit an instinctual drive to ask:

- Why did this happen?
- Who decided?
- Under what authority?
- Was it legitimate?

This reflex emerges because:
- Irreversibility demands justification
- Finite agents cannot access full causal histories
- Closure must occur under uncertainty and time pressure

Even when authorities provide explanations, full compression is impossible across a population.

---

## The Compression Problem

No execution can be fully justified to all agents because:

- Legitimacy criteria differ
- Motives are contested
- Contexts are incomplete
- Definitions are unstable (justice, threat, guilt, necessity)

Even executions of widely hated individuals do not generalize into institutional legitimacy for execution itself.

Mass hatred, fear, or moral outrage cannot serve as a load-bearing institutional structure, because once installed, execution authority becomes subject to the subjectivity of its governors.

---

## Ambient Fear and Legitimacy Erosion

When execution is institutionalized:

- Salience generalizes beyond the specific case
- Fear becomes ambient rather than localized
- Trust shifts from systems to individuals
- People begin to ask “could this apply to me?”

This undermines legitimacy, because:
- Institutions exist to produce order
- Ambient fear is not order
- Order requires predictability and bounded enforcement

As fear becomes ambient, enforcement cost rises and voluntary compliance falls.

---

## Ideological Escalation and Ontological Claims

As legitimacy fractures, discourse shifts from constraint analysis to ontology:

- Competing theories claim moral supremacy
- Sides harden
- “Us vs them” dynamics emerge
- Moral identity fuses with position

This escalation amplifies uncertainty rather than resolving it.

At the individual level, trust collapses inward until only the self is trusted, further eroding coordination.

---

## Core Structural Insight

The failure mode of execution systems is not primarily moral disagreement.

It is **salience overload under irreversibility**, combined with **unresolvable legitimacy compression** across finite agents.

Execution systems fail because they:
- Force salience
- Cannot satisfy it
- Generalize fear
- Erode trust
- Increase enforcement cost over time

---

## Reality-Tracing Implication

From a reality-tracing perspective, execution functions as a **salience stressor** that reliably degrades legitimacy, regardless of intent or justification.

This document does not command policy.  
It traces cost.
