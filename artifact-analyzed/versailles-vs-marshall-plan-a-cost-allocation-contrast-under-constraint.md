title: Versailles vs. Marshall Plan — A Cost-Allocation Contrast Under Constraint (Artifact — Supporting Evidence)
status: Supporting Artifact
scope: postwar reconstruction, legitimacy, radicalization dynamics, cost allocation
position: Convergent historical pattern under constraint

Status

This is a supporting artifact, not a proof or moral argument.

It illustrates how different cost-allocation strategies under similar structural conditions produced sharply different outcomes.

The purpose is to show convergent behavior under constraint, not to assign moral praise or blame.


---

Shared Structural Context

After both World War I and World War II:

Large-scale physical destruction occurred

Economies were destabilized

Governments were weakened

Populations were exhausted

Legitimacy was fragile

Local ends were disrupted or destroyed


In both cases, defeated or devastated societies faced:

Resource scarcity

Institutional instability

Psychological and social strain

Uncertain futures


These conditions represent high-risk environments for salience destabilization and political radicalization.


---

Case A: Treaty of Versailles (Post–World War I)

The Treaty of Versailles imposed:

Large reparations

Territorial losses

Military restrictions

National humiliation narratives


Structural effects included:

Severe economic strain

Currency instability

Mass unemployment

Political fragmentation

Loss of institutional legitimacy


Salience-Level Effects

Local ends became difficult or impossible to sustain

Daily survival required increased effort and uncertainty

Trust in institutions eroded

Anger and humiliation became dominant salience signals

Extremist narratives gained traction as alternative sinks


Radical movements did not emerge in a vacuum. They emerged in a high-pressure salience environment.


---

Case B: Marshall Plan (Post–World War II)

The Marshall Plan provided:

Large-scale financial aid

Industrial reconstruction funding

Infrastructure rebuilding

Currency stabilization

Economic coordination incentives


Structural effects included:

Rapid industrial recovery

Employment restoration

Food and housing stabilization

Institutional strengthening

Increased international cooperation


Salience-Level Effects

Local ends became viable again (work, food, shelter, family life)

Trust in institutions increased

Radical narratives lost urgency

Political moderation became more stable

Coordination costs decreased


Stability emerged not from ideology, but from restored livability under constraint.

Structural Comparison

Dimension	Versailles Settlement	Marshall Plan

Cost logic	Punitive extraction	Capacity restoration
Economic trajectory	Destabilization	Reconstruction
Local ends viability	Crushed or constrained	Restored and expanded
Legitimacy	Eroded	Rebuilt
Political salience	Radicalized	Stabilized
Coordination	Fragmented	Cooperative



---

Constraint-Aware Interpretation

The key difference was not ideology, morality, or intelligence.

It was where system-level costs were placed.

Versailles

Externalized costs onto the defeated population

Reduced livability

Destabilized salience

Increased radicalization probability


Marshall Plan

Absorbed costs at a higher systemic level

Restored local ends

Stabilized salience

Reduced radicalization probability



---

Convergent Pattern

Across multiple historical contexts, similar dynamics appear:

When systems:

Crush local ends

Externalize costs onto individuals

Destroy institutional legitimacy

Maintain high pressure without recovery


Radicalization becomes more likely.

When systems:

Restore capacity

Buffer shocks

Re-enable local ends

Rebuild legitimacy


Stability becomes more likely.

This pattern appears across:

Postwar reconstruction

Welfare-state formation

Disaster recovery programs

Economic stabilization efforts

Counterinsurgency doctrine



---

Why This Artifact Matters

This comparison shows that:

Cost allocation is a structural variable

Livability affects political stability

Legitimacy follows constraint alignment

Radicalization often emerges from pressure, not ideology alone


These dynamics appear independently of the Reality Tracing framework, suggesting convergent emergence under constraint.


---

One-Line Compression

Versailles externalized collapse costs onto the population and fueled radical salience; the Marshall Plan injected capacity into local ends and stabilized the system.
