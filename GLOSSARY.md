title: Glossary

---

This glossary defines terms as they are used in the Reality Tracing framework.

Definitions are **operational, constraint-aware, and layered**.  
They are not intended as universal, moral, or metaphysical claims.

Where terms overlap with existing disciplines, meanings are scoped to **how they function under constraint**.

---

## Core Ontology

### Reality  
Everything that exists and exerts causal constraint, whether known, unknown, modeled, unmodeled, measurable, or unenumerable.

Reality is not exhausted by description, belief, or model.

---

### Constraint  
A limiting condition that shapes what actions, outcomes, or trajectories are possible.

Constraints operate regardless of belief, intent, or moral stance.

---

### System  
An organized set of interacting components and constraints that exhibits patterned behavior over time.

Systems may be biological, cognitive, social, institutional, ecological, or technological.

---

### Emergence  
The appearance of stable, real patterns or behaviors produced by interaction among components that cannot be usefully reduced to individual parts.

Emergence does not imply mystery—only irreducibility under current constraints.

---

### Layered Reality  
The organization of reality into analytic layers (e.g., phenomenological, cognitive, social, institutional, physical) where different descriptions, tools, and failure modes apply.

No layer is sovereign by default.

---

### Irreversibility  
A condition in which actions or consequences cannot be undone within relevant limits of time, energy, capacity, or coordination.

Irreversibility defines hard boundaries on repair.

---

### Path Dependence  
The condition in which past actions constrain present and future options, making order and history materially relevant.

---

### Nonlinearity  
A property of systems where outputs are not proportional to inputs, producing thresholds, cascades, and phase shifts.

---

### Rate Sensitivity  
Sensitivity to the speed of change.

Systems, humans, and institutions have limited capacity to absorb rapid change even when total load appears manageable.

---

### Salience  
**Definition:**  
The ongoing directional flow of finite energy toward locally sustaining ends, emerging from contingent conditions and stabilizing only through habituation.

**Notes:**  
Salience is not importance at initialization.  
It becomes importance only after energy flows, stabilizes, and reinforces paths.

Salience is dynamic, non-freezeable, and observable only through effects.

---

## Epistemic and Modeling Terms

### Model  
A simplified representation used to navigate reality within a defined scope.

Models are tools, not assets.

---

### Compression  
The reduction of complex reality into simplified representations to enable cognition, coordination, and action.

All compression is lossy.

---

### Loss / Lossiness  
The information discarded during compression.

Loss is unavoidable and explains limitation—not error.

---

### Scope  
The boundary conditions under which a claim, model, or explanation remains valid.

---

### Category Error  
Applying concepts or tools from one layer of reality to another where they do not apply.

---

### Epistemic Overreach  
Making claims that exceed available evidence, model scope, or capacity to verify—often by mistaking local usefulness for global truth.

---

### Probabilistic Reasoning  
Reasoning in terms of likelihoods, distributions, and uncertainty rather than certainty or absolutes.

The highest usable form of reasoning under finite information.

---

### Reality Tracing  
The ongoing practice of keeping models, beliefs, and abstractions in contact with real constraints, pressure signals, and observed outcomes.

Reality tracing prioritizes survivability over explanatory closure.

---

### Pressure (as signal)  
Experienced strain indicating a mismatch between demands, expectations, or models and actual constraints.

Pressure is diagnostic, not moral.

---

### Model Disposal  
The deliberate abandonment of a model when it no longer tracks reality or fails under pressure.

Model disposal is a feature, not a failure.

---

### Stopping Rule  
A predefined condition that halts escalation, inference, or analysis to preserve capacity and prevent infinite regress.

Stopping rules regulate tracing.  
They are not claims about reality.

---

### Strategic / Structural Closure  
A deliberate decision to act, coordinate, or stabilize **after constraints are known**, when further tracing does not reduce uncertainty meaningfully.

Unlike stopping rules, closure belongs to living and coordination—not to truth claims.

---

## Human Cognition and Agency

### Bounded Agency  
The condition of acting with limited information, energy, attention, time, and foresight.

Agency is graded, not absolute.

---

### Bias  
The inevitable selectivity of perception and attention arising from having a position in reality.

Bias is structural, not a moral defect.

---

### Passive Bias  
Bias arising from context, embodiment, position, and access limits.

---

### Active Bias  
Bias arising from habitual or deliberate allocation of attention, care, and energy.

---

### Cognitive Load  
The amount of mental effort required to process information, regulate emotion, and make decisions.

---

### Attention  
A finite cognitive resource determining what information is processed and acted upon.

---

### Emotion  
A high-gain biological signaling system that assigns urgency, direction, and salience under constraint.

---

### Regulation (vs Suppression)  
Regulation balances cognitive modes under constraint.  
Suppression disables modes and produces rebound, distortion, or collapse.

---

### Cognitive Modes / Interfaces  
Distinct but interacting ways humans engage reality (e.g., emotion, logic, narrative, morality).

No mode is sovereign by default.

---

### Intuition  
Fast, experience-based pattern recognition operating below conscious deliberation.

Intuition is a speed-optimized inference mechanism, not irrationality.

---

## Energy, Capacity, and Cost

### Energy (structural)  
Finite embodied capacity to act, regulate, attend, coordinate, and sustain systems.

Energy appears in multiple forms across layers.

---

### Capacity  
The ability of an agent or system to absorb load without failure.

---

### Cost  
Any expenditure or burden required by action, including time, energy, health, trust, attention, or legitimacy.

---

### Cost Displacement  
The shifting of cost across people, time, layers, or systems rather than its elimination.

---

### Accounting (constraint-aware)  
Tracking where costs, risks, and irreversibility actually land across systems and time.

---

### Failure Under Load  
Breakdown occurring when demands exceed system capacity or rate limits.

---

### Fatigue  
Degradation of capacity due to sustained load or insufficient recovery.

---

### Excess Energy  
Capacity beyond immediate survival that enables care, creativity, exploration, planning, and meaning.

Preserving excess energy is structural maintenance.

---

## System Dynamics and Collapse

### Collapse  
Loss of coordinated function or capacity within a system.

Collapse may be partial, uneven, or gradual.

---

### Continuous / Probabilistic Collapse  
Collapse understood as likelihood-based, distributed, and non-singular rather than total or instantaneous.

---

### Failure Surface  
Points or regions where stress concentrates and failure initiates.

---

### Option Space  
The set of viable actions or futures available to an agent or system.

---

### Option Amnesia  
Forgetting that alternative actions or futures once existed.

---

### Recoverability  
The ability to restore function after disruption.

---

### Resilience  
Capacity to absorb disturbance and adapt without losing core function.

---

### Diversity (structural)  
Variation that decorrelates failure modes and increases survivability under shock.

---

## Social and Moral Dynamics

### Local Ends  
Bounded, human-scale targets toward which energy flows, sustaining livability under constraint.

Local ends may be concrete, abstract, suppressed, or symbolic.

---

### Meaning  
Stabilizing structures of significance that regulate motivation and sustain engagement with life.

Meaning is functional, not justificatory.

---

### Values  
Priority-setting filters that guide selection among possible actions.

---

### Morality  
Normative systems that select which futures ought to be pursued.

Morality is real but not an analytic primitive in reality tracing.

---

### Moral Overreach  
Extending moral claims beyond constraint, scope, or enforceable capacity.

---

### Moral Sequencing  
Deferring moral adjudication during crisis in favor of stabilization and harm reduction.

---

### Identity Fusion  
Binding of personal identity to group identity under sustained pressure.

---

### Fear Dynamics  
Feedback loops in which perceived threat amplifies hostility and reduces cognitive range.

---

## Governance and Coordination

### Legitimacy  
Perceived right of an authority or system to govern or coordinate action.

---

### Grounded Legitimacy  
Legitimacy derived from explicit acknowledgment of limits, needs, and constraints.

---

### Power  
Capacity to shape which futures remain possible.

---

### Pathological Power  
Power that is irreversible, unchallengeable, or invisible to those it constrains.

---

### Tyranny (as irreversibility)  
Persistent domination that irreversibly constrains others’ option space.

---

### Trust  
A bounded rational shortcut that reduces cognitive, coordination, and enforcement cost.

---

### Transparency (as infrastructure)  
Practices that prevent total secrecy and enable accountability over time.

---

### Shock Absorbers  
Institutions or mechanisms that absorb volatility and prevent harm from propagating.

---

### Constraint Storage and Release  
Accumulation of buffered capacity (e.g., trust, norms, legitimacy) and its sudden loss under overload.

---

## Conflict and Hard Problems

### Hard Problem  
A situation where constraints are known but no final solution exists, requiring continuous management, coordination, and strategic closure.

---

### Answerable Artifact  
A traced situation where constraints produce a stable structural conclusion.

---

### Hard Problem Artifact  
A traced situation that remains live, irreversible, and non-resolving despite clarity.

---

### Bad-Faith Actor  
An actor who knowingly manipulates systems or narratives for instrumental gain.

---

### Adversarial Environment  
Contexts where actors exploit trust, ambiguity, or information channels.

---

### Containment (vs Resolution)  
Managing harm and coexistence without resolving underlying disagreement.

---

### Triage  
Allocation of limited resources under unavoidable scarcity.

---

### Emergency Protocol  
Temporary, simplified rules for action under extreme constraint.

---

### Strategic Hope  
A salience-alignment mechanism that sustains coordination and non-collapse when certainty is impossible.

Hope here is structural, not emotional.

---

Rule prohibiting use of the framework to judge total persons or moral worth.

---

### Mode Non-Sovereignty  
Principle that no cognitive mode has default authority over others.

---

### Exit (without moral penalty)  
Legitimate disengagement as capacity regulation.

---

## Meta-System Concepts

---

### Convergent Evolution (probabilistic)  
Independent re-emergence of similar solutions under similar constraints.

---

### Selection Pressure  
Forces that filter which behaviors or structures persist.

Designing systems so failure occurs in bounded, repairable zones.

---

### Legitimacy Burn / Trust Contagion  
Spread of legitimacy or trust loss across systems through association.

---

### Accounting Closure  
Whether all costs and irreversibility are acknowledged rather than deferred.
