# Glossary

This glossary defines terms as they are used in the work.
Definitions are operational and constraint-aware. They are not intended as universal or moral claims.

## Core Ontology

### Reality  
Everything that exists and exerts causal constraint, whether known, unknown, modeled, or unmodeled.

### Constraint  
A limiting condition that shapes what actions, outcomes, or trajectories are possible.

### System  
An organized set of interacting components and constraints that exhibits patterned behavior over time.

### Emergence  
The appearance of stable, real patterns or behaviors produced by interactions among components that cannot be usefully reduced to individual parts.

### Layered Reality  
The organization of reality into analytic layers (e.g., phenomenological, psychological, social, institutional, physical) where different descriptions and rules apply.

### Irreversibility  
A condition in which actions or consequences cannot be undone within relevant limits of time, energy, or capacity.

### Path Dependence  
The condition in which past decisions constrain present and future options, making order and history matter.

### Nonlinearity  
A property of systems where outputs are not proportional to inputs.

### Rate Sensitivity  
Sensitivity to the speed of change; systems and humans have limited capacity to absorb rapid change.

### Salience
**Definition:**  
The ongoing directional flow of finite energy toward locally sustaining ends, emerging from contingent conditions and stabilizing only through habituation.

**Notes:**  
Salience is dynamic and non-freezeable. It is observable only through its effects—habits, attention, bias, motivation, and local ends.

## Epistemic and Modeling Terms

### Model  
A simplified representation used to understand, predict, or navigate reality within a defined scope.

### Compression  
The reduction of complex reality into simplified representations to enable cognition and action.

### Loss / Lossiness  
The information discarded during compression; unavoidable in modeling and perception.

### Scope  
The boundaries within which a claim, model, or explanation is valid.

### Category Error  
Applying concepts or tools from one layer of reality to another where they do not apply.

### Epistemic Overreach  
Making claims that exceed available evidence, model scope, or capacity to verify.

### Probabilistic Reasoning  
Reasoning in terms of likelihoods and uncertainty rather than certainty or absolutes.

### Reality Tracing  
The ongoing practice of keeping models and beliefs in contact with real constraints, pressure, and observed outcomes.

### Pressure (as signal)  
Experienced strain indicating a mismatch between demands, expectations, or models and actual constraints.

### Model Disposal  
The deliberate abandonment of a model when it no longer tracks reality or fails under pressure.

### Stopping Rule  
A predefined condition that halts escalation, inference, or action to preserve capacity.

## Human Cognition and Agency

### Bounded Agency  
The condition of acting with limited information, energy, attention, and foresight.

### Bias  
The inevitable selectivity of perception and attention that comes from having a perspective.

### Passive Bias  
Bias arising from positional constraint, context, and limited access to information.

### Active Bias  
Bias arising from deliberate or habitual allocation of attention, care, and energy.

### Cognitive Load  
The amount of mental effort required to process information and make decisions.

### Attention  
A finite cognitive resource determining what information is processed and acted upon.

### Emotion  
A high-gain biological signaling system that assigns salience, urgency, and motivation.

### Regulation (vs Suppression)  
Regulation balances cognitive modes; suppression forcibly disables them and produces rebound or distortion.

### Cognitive Modes / Interfaces  
Distinct but interacting ways humans engage reality (emotion, logic, narrative, morality, etc.).

### Intuition  
Fast, experience-based pattern recognition operating below conscious deliberation.

## Energy, Capacity, and Cost

### Energy (structural)  
Finite embodied capacity to act, regulate, attend, and sustain systems.

### Capacity  
The ability of an agent or system to absorb load without failure.

### Cost  
Any expenditure or burden required by action, including time, energy, health, trust, or attention.

### Cost Displacement  
The shifting of cost across people, time, layers, or systems rather than its elimination.

### Accounting (constraint-aware)  
Tracking where costs, risks, and irreversibility actually land across systems and time.

### Failure Under Load  
Breakdown occurring when demands exceed system capacity.

### Fatigue  
Degradation of capacity due to sustained load or insufficient recovery.

### Excess Energy  
Capacity beyond survival needs that enables care, creativity, planning, and meaning.

---

## System Dynamics and Collapse

### Collapse  
Loss of coordinated function or capacity within a system.

### Continuous / Probabilistic Collapse  
Collapse understood as uneven, gradual, and likelihood-based rather than singular or total.

### Failure Surface  
Points or regions where stress concentrates and failure initiates.

### Option Space  
The set of viable actions or futures available to an agent or system.

### Option Amnesia  
Forgetting that alternative actions or futures once existed.

### Recoverability  
The ability to restore function after disruption.

### Resilience  
Capacity to absorb disturbance and adapt without losing core function.

### Diversity (structural)  
Variation that decorrelates failure modes and increases adaptability.

---

## Social and Moral Dynamics

### Local Ends  
Immediate, human-scale sources of meaning, attachment, and motivation.

### Meaning  
Structures of significance that regulate motivation and sustain engagement with life.

### Values  
Priority-setting filters that guide choices among possible actions.

### Morality  
Normative systems that select which futures ought to be pursued.

### Moral Overreach  
Extending moral claims beyond constraint, scope, or capacity to enforce.

### Moral Sequencing  
Deferring moral adjudication during crisis in favor of stabilization and harm reduction.

### Identity Fusion  
The binding of personal identity to group identity under pressure.

### Fear Dynamics  
Feedback loops in which perceived threat amplifies hostility and reduces cognitive range.

---

## Governance and Coordination

### Legitimacy  
Perceived right of an authority or system to govern or coordinate action.

### Grounded Legitimacy  
Legitimacy derived from explicit acknowledgment of limits, needs, and constraints.

### Power  
Capacity to shape which futures remain possible.

### Pathological Power  
Power that is irreversible, unchallengeable, or invisible.

### Tyranny (as irreversibility)  
Persistent domination that irreversibly constrains others’ option space.

### Trust  
A bounded rational shortcut that reduces cognitive and coordination cost.

### Transparency (as infrastructure)  
Practices that prevent total secrecy and enable accountability over time.

### Shock Absorbers  
Institutions or mechanisms that absorb volatility and prevent harm from propagating.

### Constraint Storage and Release  
The accumulation of buffered capacity (e.g., trust, norms) and its sudden loss under overload.

---

## Conflict and Hard Cases

### Bad-Faith Actor  
An actor who knowingly manipulates systems or narratives for instrumental gain.

### Good-Faith Hard Stance  
A sincere, non-negotiable commitment held without intent to deceive or exploit.

### Adversarial Environment  
Contexts where actors actively exploit trust, ambiguity, or information channels.

### Narrative Ignition  
Rapid activation of fear or identity through symbolic or emotional triggers.

### Containment (vs Resolution)  
Managing harm and coexistence without resolving underlying disagreement.

### Triage  
Allocation of limited resources under unavoidable scarcity.

### Emergency Protocol  
Temporary, simplified rules for action under extreme constraint.

### Hard Case  
Situations involving scarcity, high stakes, irreversibility, and moral conflict.

---

## Meta and Use Boundaries

### Non-Adjudication Principle  
Rule prohibiting use of the framework to judge total persons or moral worth.

### Mode Non-Sovereignty  
Principle that no cognitive mode has default authority over others.

### Default Non-Reinforcement  
Rule that no mode or value is amplified without contextual justification.

### Exit (without moral penalty)  
Allowing disengagement as legitimate capacity regulation.

## Meta-System Concepts

### Convergent Evolution (probabilistic)  
Independent re-emergence of similar solutions under similar constraints.

### Selection Pressure  
Forces that filter which behaviors or structures persist.

### Failure Localization  
Designing systems so failure occurs in bounded, repairable zones.

### Legitimacy Burn / Trust Contagion  
Spread of legitimacy loss across institutions through association.

### Accounting Closure  
Whether all costs and consequences of actions are fully accounted for rather than deferred.
