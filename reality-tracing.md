# Reality Tracing

Intent

Reality Tracing is a practice, not a theory and not an ontology of everything.

Its purpose is to trace constraints, flows, and limits across human-scale emergent systems (cognition, identity, culture, institutions) while explicitly refusing overreach.

Reality Tracing exists to fill a missing discipline:

one that treats human systems as real and causal,

without pretending they can be fully formalized or closed,

and without declaring them ineffable or beyond analysis.


It applies the same epistemic restraint learned in physics to higher emergent realities.

What Reality Tracing Is Not

Reality Tracing is not:

a total explanation of humans

a replacement for psychology, neuroscience, sociology, economics, law, or governance

a moral framework

a predictive engine

a claim about ultimate metaphysics


It does not explain what humans are. It traces what humans are constrained by.

Core Stance

1. Constraints Are Primary

Reality Tracing starts from the assumption that:

we are constrained agents inside the system we are trying to understand

energy, attention, salience, habituation, incentives, and history all impose limits


Constraints are treated as first-class objects.


---

2. Bayesian Reasoning Is Local, Not Final

Bayesian reasoning is extremely useful when:

the hypothesis space is known

the frame is stable

compression is required


But Reality Tracing explicitly recognizes a non-Bayesian boundary:

the space of possible ideas, causes, and interpretations is not enumerable

new salience objects and categories can emerge


Therefore:

Bayesian reasoning works within frames

Reality Tracing governs when frames themselves break or are incomplete


Bayes is a tool of constrained minds, not an ontology of reality.


---

3. Salience Governs Action

Reality Tracing treats salience as the main regulator of behavior:

anything in the mind can become an idea

ideas, feelings, sensations, memories, and even meta-ideas can become salient

salience determines what receives energy and action


Habituation limits salience over time, preventing infinite loops.

This explains:

habits

bias formation

identity stabilization

burnout

overthinking

social contagion


Without invoking essence or moral failure.


---

4. Micro-Interactions Accumulate Without Total Causation

Every interaction leaves some trace. Most dissipate. Some amplify through salience and reinforcement.

No single event can be shown to be globally causative of a person.

Because:

amplification is nonlinear

countervailing interaction sets can arrive unpredictably

the full interaction space is unknowable


Reality Tracing allows partial causation, but forbids total explanation.


---

5. Biology Bounds, It Does Not Dictate

Biological diversity shapes:

what can become salient

how salience is constructed

how quickly habituation occurs


But loss or difference in sensory channels does not prevent participation in higher emergent layers.

Salience operates on representations, not raw signals.


---

6. Identity Is Emergent, Not Sacred or Reducible

Identity (including gender) is understood as:

a stabilized bundle of salient representations

reinforced by habit, social feedback, embodiment, and history


This applies to everyone equally.

Reality Tracing:

does not deny identity

does not reduce identity to biology

does not elevate identity to ontology


It traces identity as an emergent constraint configuration.


---

Why This Practice Is Needed

Without a named discipline:

human sciences may be dismissed as unreal by outsiders

practitioners may overclaim and slide into ontology


Reality Tracing creates a shared stopping rule:

these systems are real

these explanations are partial

these models do not close reality


This prevents both:

romantic anti-formalization

scientistic overreach



---

Social Function

Reality Tracing provides a shared language that allows people to:

disagree without total blame

explain without single-cause narratives

argue within constraints

recognize uncertainty without paralysis


It shifts discourse from:

finger-pointing

essence claims

moral totalization


toward:

constraint analysis

salience mismatches

incentive structure

historical contingency



---

Ontological Claim (Minimal)

Reality Tracing makes only one ontological claim:

> What we can legitimately trace is not reality in itself, but the constraints that shape our access to it.



This is an ontology of limits, not of substances.


---

In Short

Reality Tracing is:

formal without being total

real without being reductionist

humble without being dismissive

analytical without being dehumanizing


It applies Bohr-style epistemic discipline to higher emergent realities.

Nothing more. Nothing less.
