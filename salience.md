#Salience

Anything can become an idea. Any grouping of ideas can itself be treated as an idea. Sets of ideas can be operationalized into movement, habits, and local ends. Salience is the direction of this movement: the ongoing reinforcement of certain ideas, patterns, and actions through the allocation of finite energy over time.

As salient patterns stabilize, they are reinforced through habituation. When habits align with salient local ends, this alignment is experienced as reward and restoration. When salient paths are disrupted, blocked, or rendered non-viable, the system experiences pain, fatigue, or distress as corrective signals. These signals are not moral judgments but efficiency feedback, indicating misalignment between energy use, habit, and continued viability.
