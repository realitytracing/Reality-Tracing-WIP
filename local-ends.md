# Local Ends

Local ends are immediate, human-scale sources of meaning, attachment, agency, and stabilization that sustain continued viability under constraint.

They include:
- Needs and wants
- The lived outcomes of pursuing those wants
- Repetition, presence, and continuity
- Experiences that restore or preserve energy and coherence

Local ends are not ideals, moral achievements, or final goals. They are bounded completions that make life livable within finite time, energy, and capacity.

Local ends function as buffers. They absorb stress, regulate emotional load, and prevent escalation under normal pressure. Anger, fear, and frustration can exist without destabilization when local ends remain viable.

There is a structural asymmetry:
- Anger can exist without threatening local ends.
- Threats to local ends sharply increase the probability of saturation into violence, collapse, or withdrawal.

The destruction or erosion of local ends eliminates reasons for preservation and accelerates failure. Protecting local ends preserves recovery capacity even when broader systems are unstable.

Local ends are legitimate. They require no justification beyond their role in sustaining life under constraint.
