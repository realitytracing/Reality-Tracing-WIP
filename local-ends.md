# Local Ends

Local ends are immediate, human-scale sources of meaning, attachment, and completion that sustain viability under constraint. They are bounded in scope and time, experienced directly, and provide restoration, regulation, or motivation that enables continued action.

Local ends are not final goals, ideals, or utopias. They are locally sufficient completions that make ongoing life livable within finite energy, attention, and time.

# Why Local Ends Exist (Structural, Not Moral)

Local ends arise because human agents operate under finite energy, limited attention, rate sensitivity, and irreversibility. Continuous life without bounded completion produces overload, despair, or collapse. Local ends provide partial closure and restoration without requiring total resolution of systems or history.
Local ends are therefore not indulgences; they are energy-regulating mechanisms.

# Functional Types of Local Ends
(These are classes, not exhaustive lists. They overlap and are context-dependent. This is a useful artifact as a set, but not necessary.)


**Restorative Local Ends**

Definition:
Local ends that restore depleted capacity and reduce accumulated load, enabling recovery from stress, fatigue, or overload.

Function:
Energy replenishment
Load reduction
Rate reset
Examples are intentionally omitted at the definition level.


**Stabilizing Local Ends**

Definition:
Local ends that maintain continuity, predictability, and identity over time, reducing uncertainty and cognitive cost.

Function:
Habitual grounding
Continuity of self and environment
Reduced variance


**Expressive Local Ends**

Definition:
Local ends that allow expression, play, creativity, intimacy, or exploration, enabling flexible engagement beyond survival needs.

Function:
Excess energy utilization
Salience diversification
Meaning expansion


**Instrumental Local Ends**

Definition:
Local ends that advance practical capabilities, problem-solving, or skill use, often serving as bridges between present conditions and future viability.

Function:
Capability maintenance
Option space preservation

# Adaptive leverage
Local Ends and Energy Regulation

Local ends regulate energy by providing bounded points of completion where effort yields lived outcome. This prevents indefinite expenditure without return, which would otherwise produce overload or collapse.
The absence of attainable local ends forces agents into sustained extraction mode, increasing fatigue, fear, and aggression.

# Threat, Loss, and Destruction of Local Ends

Threats to local ends function as high-salience signals because they indicate loss of livability rather than abstract harm. Destruction of local ends removes reasons for restraint and preservation, accelerating collapse dynamics.
People may tolerate extreme hardship while local ends remain viable. When they are removed, behavior shifts nonlinearly.


# Non-Idealization Principle (Critical)

Local ends are not inherently moral, healthy, prosocial, or admirable. They may be destructive, exclusionary, or misaligned with long-term viability. Their importance is structural, not ethical.
Ignoring or moralizing local ends does not eliminate them; it merely drives them underground or into destabilizing forms.

Local ends function as redundant stability mechanisms. Individual collapse occurs when the density of attainable local ends falls below a viable threshold per individual.
